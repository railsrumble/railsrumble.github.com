<p>I&#8217;m happy to report that our panel, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/7765">&#8216;Starting Up Fast: Lessons from the Rails Rumble&#8217;</a>, has been accepted for the 4th annual <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/">Railsconf</a> event in Las Vegas.</p><p><img src="http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/24/rails2009_125x125.jpg" width="125" height="125"  border="0"  alt="RailsConf 2009" title="RailsConf 2009" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px;" /></p><p>I&#8217;ll be moderating a panel of competition winners and participants, and we&#8217;ll be discussing how they were able to achieve some impressive feats in the compressed contest timeframe. It should be packed full of useful real-world advice on how to organize and launch Rails applications quickly. We&#8217;ll also talk about the event itself, and the nature of innovation competitions in general (and why you should get involved!)</p><p>Panelists include our friends <a href="http://faithfulgeek.org">Joe Fiorini</a> (grand prize winner 2008), <a href="http://gethandcrafted.com">Josh Owens</a> (grand prizer winner 2007, design award 2008), <a href="http://www.culann.com/">Ben Scofield</a> (winner, solo division for both 2007 and 2008), <a href="http://giraffesoft.ca">James Golick</a> (winner, most useful 2008), and <a href="http://blog.ninjahideout.com/">Darcy Laycock</a>, who participated in the 2007 contest and joined the organizational team for the 2008 event.</p><p>So if you&#8217;re making the voyage to the City of Sin in May, make sure to check us out. I&#8217;m excited, and it&#8217;ll be great to meet many of you there!</p>
