title: Rumble Primer Screencast
---
<p>Last year our pal <a href="http://smartic.us">Bryan Liles</a> put together a great Rails Rumble primer screencast detailing host setup, configuration, and end to end Rails application deployment. People swooned over its awesomeness. It was really, really good.</p><p>Fortunately for you, he&#8217;s done it again this year, updating the content for the 2008 contest and including GitHub and Passenger. <a href="http://smartic.us/2008/10/8/rails-rumble-2008-primer">Check it out</a>. And, as Bryan says, <span class="caps">TATFT</span>.</p>
