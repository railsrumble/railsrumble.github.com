---

The winners of 2014 Rails Rumble, picked by this year's competitors, have been announced, so [go check them out](http://railsrumble.com/entries/winners)!

Winners will be receiving a number of [awesome prizes from our sponsors](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2014/10/03/prizes-prizes-prizes/), like gift certificates and free access to services (thanks, [sponsors](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2014/10/08/meet-the-sponsors/))!

Teams, you should now feel free to deploy any updates you have waiting. We'll email you this week with details regarding your Heroku app and GitHub repository. And if you're in the Top 10, or won either the Best Solo or Public Favorite awards, you'll also be hearing from us with details on how to get your prizes, but please give us a couple of weeks to get your prizes ready.

Additionally, if you want to see how many points your team accumulated from competitor judges, sign in with Heroku and visit your team's dashboard.

Thanks to all the [participants](http://railsrumble.com/participants), and public voters, for taking part in the 2014 Rumble!
