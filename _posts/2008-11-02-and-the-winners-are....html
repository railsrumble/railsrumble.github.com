Whether they finished or not, and whether they ranked at the top of the leaderboard or not, everyone did fantastic work. Last year we selected a number of entries for honorable mentions. This year we&#8217;re not doing that because there are simply too many to list. Totally serious.</p><p>Many thanks to all the additional voters that joined us to help judge entries. We had a truly great turnout this year. Stay tuned to this blog, where we&#8217;ll be posting winners of the randomly selected judging prizes and more in the days to come.</p>
