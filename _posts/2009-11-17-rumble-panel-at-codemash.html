title: Rumble Panel at CodeMash
---
<p>Back in May, I moderated a panel at <a href="http://railsconf.com">Railsconf 2009</a> to answer questions about developing web applications in 48 hours for the Rails Rumble competition. We're excited to announce that this panel will be revisited at <a href="http://www.codemash.org">CodeMash 2010</a>.</p><p>This time the panel will be moderated by former panelist <a href="http://www.joefiorini.com">Joe Fiorini</a> and 2008 grand prize winner <a href="http://www.joshwlash.com">Josh Walsh</a>. Panelists include <a href="http://4beansoup.com">Josh Owens</a> (grand prize winner 2007, finalist 2009), <a href="http://www.wavethenavel.com">Jonathan Penn</a> (grand prize winner 2008, finalist 2009), <a href="http://www.onestepback.org">Jim Weirich</a> (participant 2008), <a href="http://www.joshreedschramm.com">Josh Schramm</a> (participant 2009), and <a href="http://digimatt.mattyoho.com">Matt Yoho</a> (participant 2009). As with the Railsconf panel, questions will be released on Google moderator before the start of the conference (stay tuned for that announcement). At that time we'll need your help to provide questions for the panelists to answer.</p><h3>About CodeMash</h3><p>CodeMash is an annual conference held in Sandusky, Ohio at the Kalahari indoor waterpark and resort.
