title: Tender & The Rumble
---
<p>  In an effort to improve the competition this year,  The RailsRumble team has made a number of changes to  different aspects of the competition. Two of the most prominent   changes were the introduction of our automated verification  system ("Pugalier" internally) which will be discussed in  later posts and our switch to using <a href="http://tenderapp.com/">Tender</a>,  by the cool team over at <a href="http://entp.com/">entp</a>.</p><p>  In addition to the method we've used in previous years,  <a href="irc://irc.freenode.org">IRC</a>, we've modified our  workflow to make it easier for us to handle and delegate  support using Tender. Every page in the rumble app now  features an embedded support widget and with special  thanks to <a href="http://brianturnbull.com/">Brian Turnbull</a>,  (one of Rumble team members), support has been churning  along a lot better.</p>  <p>  Tender's worked well for us this year and has made it  a lot easier for us to respond to and help teams. As  an extra bonus, the entp guys not only sponsored our  <a href="http://support.railsrumble.com/">Tender install</a>  but have also provided <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/prizes">a ton  of awesome prizes</a> which this years contestants can  get a chance to win!</p>
