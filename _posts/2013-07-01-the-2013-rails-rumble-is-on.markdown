title: The 2013 Rails Rumble is On!
---

That's right, 2 years in a row!

We're extremely pleased to announce that on **October 19th and 20th**, the 2013 Rails Rumble will be in full swing!

* Registration: Oct. 7th - 13th
* Competition: Oct. 19th - 20th

Last year we released an [incredible redesign](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2012/09/20/introducing-our-new-identity/) and leveled the playing field with a [brand new judging system](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2012/09/13/registration-dates-competition-details/), then proceeded to break all the Rails Rumble records by offering [more prizes than ever](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2012/10/13/prizes-prizes-prizes/) and signing up [over 500 teams](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2012/10/08/the-biggest-rumble-yet/)! This year, we're ready to make it even better.

If you don't know what the Rails Rumble is, and you think it involves pugilism, you're half right. Rails Rumble is the original 48 hour distributed programming competition, where teams of up to 4 people compete for 2 days to design, develop, deploy, and duke it out with other teams all around the world. But we don't use fists. We use Ruby and coffee.

It takes more than just coffee-fueled competitors, though! Just like in previous years, the Rails Rumble can't happen without [great sponsors](http://railsrumble.com/#sponsors). So if you have a product or service, and might be interested in sponsoring the 2013 Rumble, please [let us know](/sponsors).

We'll have a ton of great stuff for you between now and the competition, so be sure to follow [@railsrumble](https://twitter.com/railsrumble) on Twitter and subscribe to our [RSS feed](http://blog.railsrumble.com/atom.xml) in <del>Google Reader</del> some random feed reading service that just launched last week.
