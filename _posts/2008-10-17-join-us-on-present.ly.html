<p><a class="right" href="http://present.ly"><img src="http://blog.railsrumble.com/images/2008/9/16/presently.jpg" alt="Present.ly" border="0" /></a><p>Our buds over at <a href="http://intridea.com">Intridea</a> have provided us with a <a href="http://present.ly">Present.ly</a> account to use for the duration of the Rumble.  Thanks guys, you rock!</p></p><p>If you have already created a Present.ly account for the Rails Rumble, <a href="https://rumble.presentlyapp.com/session/new">click here to log in</a>.</p><p>To give you some background info, <a href="http://present.ly">Present.ly</a> is a communication platform that, like Twitter, is designed to allow for short, frequent updates to be posted by individuals and tracked or &#8220;followed&#8221; by others. Unlike Twitter, however, <a href="http://present.ly">Present.ly</a> provides a secure and private way to share updates among members of a company or organization without it being visible to the outside world.</p><p><a href="http://present.ly">Present.ly</a> offers several features that should be of particular interest to Rails Rumblers:</p><ul><li><b>Groups</b> &#8211; with <a href="http://present.ly">Present.ly</a>, you can create a group of your Rails Rumble teammates.  When you send updates out to a group, only the members of the group will see your updates.</li><li> <b>Attachments</b> &#8211; use <a href="http://present.ly">Present.ly</a> to share your most recent mockup, screencast, or data diagram.  You can attach files to your updates, which appear right in your update stream.</li><li> <b>Text Attachments / Code Snippets</b> &#8211; need more than 140 characters to get your point across, or want to share a code snippet with language-specific code highlighting?  Use our text attachments to attach longer text or code snippets to your update.</li><li> <b>Twitter integration</b> &#8211; rather than taking the time to post separately to both Present.ly and Twitter, you can now post to Twitter through <a href="http://present.ly">Present.ly</a>.  Just configure your Twitter username and password in Settings, and start your update/tweet with t!.  Your post will automatically be dual-posted to Twitter and <a href="http://present.ly">Present.ly</a>.</li></ul><p>Invitations have now been sent to everyone on our mailing list, if you don&#8217;t get one or are not on our list but would like one, please <a href="mailto:info@railsrumble.com">shoot us an email</a>! </p>
