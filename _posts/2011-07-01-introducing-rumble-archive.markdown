title: Introducing the Rumble Alumni Archive
---

Hello everyone! Long-time, no-speak. We hope you've been well.

2011 has been a busy year for all of the Rumble organizers so far, and
as such there's currently no date set for Rails Rumble 2011. However,
(OMFG!) we're making more concrete plans very soon. So stay tuned!

In the meantime, check out the new
<a href="http://archive.railsrumble.com">RR Alumni Archive</a> mini site!
Designed to be a showcase for websites and applications that were developed
during the Rumble, you can browse the archive to view entries by year,
by country of origin, and by award.

Did you know that there are over 80 applications developed during Rails
Rumble events that are still online and kicking ass? Of course you did.
But did you also know that many of them have evolved significantly and
are still being actively developed, such as
<a href="http://www.commendablekids.com/">Commendable Kids</a> (2010),
<a href="http://mocksup.com/">Mocksup</a> (2009),
<a href="http://railswizard.org/">Rails Wizard</a>, and
<a href="http://ioumate.com">IOU Mate</a> (2008, formerly "nDebted")?
What you start in a weekend can really have a lasting impact!

So check it out, see how your favorite entry is doing today, and of
course, let us know if we've missed anybody in our listing. We tried to be
as thorough as possible but I've no doubt there are others out there
(especially entries from 2007).

Stay in touch Rumblers! And we'll have more info about future events
soon.
