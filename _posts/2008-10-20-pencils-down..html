<p>Alright people, the build portion of the 2008 Rails Rumble competition is now officially closed. Please resist the temptation to push any further changes to your Linodes or you will be disqualified. Srsly. As Darcy mentioned in the previous blog post, competing teams still have 24 hours to finish editing their profiles and provide <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys to us.</p><p>Once that&#8217;s settled it will take us a day or two to sort through all the contributions before opening the voting floodgates. Stay tuned. We&#8217;ll post an announcement via the blog and the alerts list when voting has officially begun. In the meantime, if you&#8217;ve been a casual observer until now, make sure you <a href="http://railsrumble.com/login">Sign up to judge</a>!</p><p>From what we&#8217;ve seen so far, we&#8217;re very, very (very!) impressed with the quality of the applications this year. We think you will be too. There are some truly amazing ideas. Thank you all for your hard work.</p>
