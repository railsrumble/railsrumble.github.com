Don't have an idea for your app yet?  Consider building something around
the free services offered by our sponsors.  Yep, you heard that right, *Free!*

Some of our sponsors are stepping up and offering their hosted services
free-of-charge to Rumble teams to use in their entries.  There's lots of
great stuff available ... for example:

* Free image processing from <a href="http://uploadjuicer.com/">UploadJuicer</a>
* Free video processing from <a href="http://zencoder.com/">ZenCoder</a>
* Free HTML5 web socket services from <a href="http://pusherapp.com/">Pusher</a>
* Free email sending from <a href="http://postageapp.com/">PostageApp</a>
* Free voice, SMS, Twitter, and IM support from <a href="http://www.tropo.com/">Tropo</a>

If you're interested, <a href="http://railsrumble.com/login">login to the competition app</a> and head to your team profile for details on how to arrange use of offered sponsor services for your app.
