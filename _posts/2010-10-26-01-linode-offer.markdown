The Linode VPS provided to each Rumble team is going end-of-life on
November 12th, 2010.  Details on how to convert a competition VPS
to a paid plan (with 2 months free after the first paid month!) will
be emailed to all Rumble participants by Thursday, October 28th.  If
you don't receive yours by Friday, please
<a href="http://www.linode.com/members">log in to your competition VPS</a>
with your Rumble credentials and open a Linode support ticket.
