Psst!  Hey you.  Yes, you.  Look over there to the right ... no, your other right ... no, past the graphic.  See that little box titled, "Important Dates"?  Now I got your attention.

### Registration Open!

We've opened registration for the 2010 Rails Rumble, so gather up your team and get on over to <a href="http://railsrumble.com">the registration desk</a> and reserve your spot today before they're all gone.  Our infrastructure partners at <a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> have joined us again for the fourth year running and have outdone themselves yet again by offering up resources for <strong>300</strong> teams to compete this year.  There are no extras in the back room &mdash; what you see is what you get so get yours before they're gone!
