Add this date to your calendars: **October 15-17, 2010**

That's right, we're back again! It's time to start revving your engines for the next Rails Rumble - the 48-hour challenge that gives developers a chance to show off just how powerful Ruby and Rails can be!

For those new to the Rumble, imagine this:

*On a Friday evening (for most of us), you sit at your computer, with up to three of your closest friends nearby, when suddenly your Twitter stream starts flooding! Your IRC windows start flashing by! Your friends start clicking rapidly on their own machines! "It's up!" one of them yells.*

*You have forty-eight hours, up to three friends, a shared Git repository, a remote server, and Rails (or your favorite Rack-based framework). From that point on, it's up to you - to design, develop, and deploy the greatest web application the world has ever seen!*

Sound awesome? Add ninjas, rewards, a championship belt, for goodness sake! And to top it off, you'll be competing against some of the coolest people in the Rails industry. But don't just take our word for it...

You can code on a boat, like the Great Lakes Geeks did last year! In 2008, they took the grand prize for the <a href="http://meetinbetween.us/">MeetInBetween.us</a> application

Last year, their submission didn't place, but it came really close, and they got to code on a boat! Certainly sounds like a win to us!

Or take a look at the folks at Zencoder, whose submission last year, <a href="http://zencoder.com/">ZenVDN</a>, took the prize for Most Useful. They got accepted by YCombinator, and have launched a successful business!!

Perhaps even more fun, the team that developed the Innovation-award-winning <a href="http://lazeroids.com/">Lazeroids</a>, had so much fun with their application, they decided to write it again, using Node.js!

So start thinking about what you might want to build, and who you might want to work with. Your Rumble admins are working hard to make sure this is going to be the best Rumble yet! We'll be posting more information as the date gets closer, but make sure to mark it off on your calendar - the 4th Rails Rumble event is going to rock your world like it's never been rocked before!
