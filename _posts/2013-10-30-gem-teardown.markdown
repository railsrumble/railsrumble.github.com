Keeping with tradition, [Adam Doppelt](https://twitter.com/adamdoppelt) of Dwellable just released the [2013 Rails Rumble Gem Teardown](http://www.dwellable.com/blog/Rails-Rumble-Gem-Teardown)! It's a great read, so definitely check it out. And thanks to all the teams that anonymously submitted their Gemfiles for dissection, and of course, thanks to Adam for crunching this data!
