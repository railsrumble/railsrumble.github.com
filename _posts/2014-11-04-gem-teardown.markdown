Keeping with tradition, [Adam Doppelt](https://twitter.com/adamdoppelt) of Dwellable and Patrick Oâ€™Donnell, just released the [2014 Rails Rumble Gem Teardown](https://www.dwellable.com/blog/Rails-Rumble-Gem-Teardown)! It's a great read, so definitely check it out. And thanks to all the teams that anonymously submitted their Gemfiles for dissection, and of course, thanks to Adam and Patrick for crunching this data!
