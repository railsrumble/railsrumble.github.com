title: "Rails Rumble is now Ruby Rampage!"
---

Throughout the years, teams have always asked if they had to use Rails, or could they use another Ruby framework instead. And we've always said you could use any Ruby framework you wanted. Well, now it's time to make it official. Rails Rumble is now [Ruby Rampage](http://rubyrampage.com)! The rules are still the same, though. Teams of up to 4 people compete over a 48 hour period to build the best app they can, using Ruby. We're also keeping the BELT!

You didn't think we were getting rid of the belt, did you? Come on, we're not animals.

But wait, there's more! In addition to renaming the Rails Rumble as [Ruby Rampage](http://rubyrampage.com), we've also announced this year's competition! So [head on over](http://rubyrampage.com) and reserve a spot for your team. See you next month!
