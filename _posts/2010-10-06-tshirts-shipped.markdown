The 2010 Rails Rumble shirts shipped out today.  There were a couple snags that delayed printing and shipping by a couple days, so we ponied-up for USPS Priority shipping for international destinations to get them moving a bit quicker.  Shirts should be hitting mailboxes early next week for North America (maybe even this week!) and late next week for everywhere else.

A big thank-you to Joe at <a href="http://www.tshirtsforhumans.com/">Tshirts for Humans</a> for working with us to make this possible and also David at <a href="http://intridea.com/">Intridea</a> for his help producing the most excellent graphic adorning the shirt front!
