This is just a friendly reminder... Rails Rumble 2010 build weekend wraps up
in less than 60 minutes. If you're competing, you should be
pretty much done at this point. Please take the last hour to make sure that
you've tagged and deployed the final version of your code and that you've
successfully run the verification process as described
<a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/blog/2010/10/16/02-were-halfway-there">here</a>.

(If you tagged too early, <a href="http://gist.github.com/631414">here's a
quick fix</a>)

This is very important. We will not be allowing any code changes after the
bell rings this year. I repeat, <strong>we will not be allowing any code changes after
the bell rings this year.</strong> No excuses. :)  If you are not verified you will not
be able to enter the judging round.

Also make sure to list any resources you used during the competition on your
team profile. And if you're competing in a <a href="/challenges">sponsor
challenge</a> ensure that you've selected to opt-in to that challenge from
your team profile.

Thanks and good luck wrapping things up!
