title: Need Ideas? We Got Ideas.

<p>Just a few days left until the Rumble and some of you are probably still looking for that knock-down drag-out win-everything idea right? In the &#8220;Rumble Panel&#8221; this year at RailsConf we heard various strategies from previous winners &#8211; some deciding on the all important idea at the very last minute! Just in case you are still looking we thought we would point you to some recent rumblings in the blogosphere:</p><ul><li><a href="http://twitter.com/croaky">Dan Croak</a> of <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/">Thoughtbot</a> (one of our awesome sponsors) put together a list of possible applications and teams are already signing up if they are interested: <a href="http://rumblestiltskin.heroku.com">http://rumblestiltskin.heroku.com</a>.</li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/jolieodell">Jolie O&#8217;Dell</a>, one of our Expert Panel Judges posted an article today on ReadWriteWeb about <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/six_awesome_apps_that_are_begging_to_be_developed.php">6 Awesome Apps That Are Begging to Be Developed</a> inspired by the YCombinator list of <a href="http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html">Startup ideas they&#8217;d like to fund</a>.</li><li><a href="http://twitter.com/smeade">Scott Meade</a> posted a great article over on his blog <a href="http://scottmeade.com/rumble-techstars/">comparing the RailsRumble to TechStars</a>, another one of our awesome sponsors (offering up a very cool prize this year!).</li></ul><p><img src="http://blog.railsrumble.com/images/2009/8/18/openid-icon-100x100.png" align="left" style="margin:10px;"> Some of the best ideas are those that don&#8217;t require a login to use. Our audience is trying to use your application quickly and requiring hours of data input from your users will hurt your chances. If you need a login, <strong>you should use OpenID and leverage the fact that all your judges are guaranteed to have an open id</strong>. As always, planning will help you but executing is the key.</p>
