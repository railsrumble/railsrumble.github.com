<p>Hola Rumblers!</p><p>It&#8217;s almost the end of the competition&#8212;less than 3 hours to go.We need you to do a couple things to make your entry official.</p><h2>Tag Your Code</h2><p>Once your code is done, you&#8217;ll need to push it to github, tagit, and then deploy to your server with said tag. If you&#8217;re notsure how, we&#8217;ve produced a short little screencast to walkyou through the process.</p><div style="text/align: center">  <div style="text-align: center">    <object classid='clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B' width="550"    height="450" codebase='http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab'>    <param name='src' value="http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/25089/rumble-tagging.mov">    <param name='autoplay' value="false">    <param name='controller' value="true">    <param name='loop' value="true">    <embed src="http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/25089/rumble-tagging.mov" width="550" height="450" autoplay="false"     controller="true" loop="true" pluginspage='http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/'>    </embed>    </object>  </div></div><p>If you don&#8217;t want to watch the whole screencast, you can insteadjust use the following commands from your application root. Note,you&#8217;ll want to commit and push any changes to github first.</p><code>git tag railsrumble<br />git push<br />git push --tags</code><p>Then, you need to go to your github page to verify it has beenadded (if you hover over the &#8216;tags&#8217; item at the top, it should show&#8216;railsrumble&#8217; as a link). Once that&#8217;s done, you need to update yourapplication to use the tagged version of the code. If you&#8217;re usingCapistrano, it&#8217;s as easy as setting / changing your branch in yourconfig/deploy.rb file.</p><code>set :branch, "railsrumble"</code> <p>And then deploy once more. You can verify it by comparing the hash next to &#8220;commit&#8221; when you click on the railsrumble tagon github (if you&#8217;re confused, please see the video).</p><p><div style='text-align: center'></p>  <img src="http://img.skitch.com/20081019-rjgu2nscct4ani44krjps2cd51.jpg" alt="github-tag"/></div><p>If you  have manually cloned it to your server, you just need to typethe following:</p><code>git pull<br />git checkout railsrumble</code><p>And it should be done.</p><h2>Server SSH Keys / Access</h2><p>For us to be able to examine your deployed application, we&#8217;re going toneed you to do two things. First off, we&#8217;ll need you to add addour ssh public key to the user you&#8217;ve deployed as (or a user who can read all of your deployed application&#8217;s files) &#8211; said keybeing available at <a href="http://railsrumble.com/rumble_id_rsa.pub">http://railsrumble.com/rumble_id_rsa.pub</a>If you&#8217;re using ubuntu / debian, the following should workwhen logged in as said user:</p><code>cd ~<br />mkdir -p .ssh<br />wget http://railsrumble.com/rumble_id_rsa.pub<br />cat rumble_id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys<br />chmod 700 .ssh<br />chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys</code><p>Once that has been done, we need you to visit your team profile(e.g. http://railsrumble.com/teams/my-awesome-team) and find the greysection just under the title for the &#8220;WHERE&#8221; section which containsa link to set the username which you added the aforementionedssh public key to.</p><p><div style='text-align: center'>=<a href="http://skitch.com/sutto/3dxd/rumble-ssh-username"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20081019-qhkxwtmtetb2cm8mpqubuppeku.preview.jpg" alt="Rumble-SSH-Username" /></a></div></p><p>Finally, Once that&#8217;s been completed / added (and the your deployedusername appears under the where section on your team profileas &#8220;Your VPS Username&#8221;), we&#8217;ll verify access over the next few days.</p><h2>Profile Changes</h2><p>Once the competition is closed, your team will have 24 hoursto edit it&#8217;s profile. What this means for you is that if you wishto add a screenshot, a info / screencast url &#8211; you mustdo so before 23:59GMT on October 20th.</p><p>Please note that if you submitted a screenshot earlier and it isn&#8217;tshowing up on your team profile, you will need to readd it now.</p><h2>The Competition Close</h2><p><strong>Summary</strong>: Repository must have tag at competition close, you have24 hours to add the other stuff starting from the competition end.</p><p>That&#8217;s pretty much all of it now for the actual required stuff.You&#8217;ll still be able to access your VPS and GitHub repositoriesonce the competition closes &#8211; just make sure you don&#8217;t change thecode deployed for your application (e.g. so you can use script/consoleand you can restart servers etc BUT you can&#8217;t edit / add migrationsor change your app code).</p><p>Most of all, thanks for competing &#8211; we hope you&#8217;ve all had a blastand we look forward to seeing just what can be built in 48 hours.</p>
