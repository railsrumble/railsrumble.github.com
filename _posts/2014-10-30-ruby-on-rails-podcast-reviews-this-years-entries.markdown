---

Prior to [the winners being revealed on Monday](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2014/10/27/winners-announced/), Sean Devine of 5by5's Ruby on Rails Podcast [released a new episode](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/173) where he talked about a number of his favorite entries from this year's rumble. So take a listen and see how his picks did, or didn't, line up with the real winners.

And coming soon from the Ruby on Rails Podcast will be interviews with the [overall winning team](http://railsrumble.com/entries/85-refactorcop), and the [solo winner](http://railsrumble.com/entries/243-pack-pal).
