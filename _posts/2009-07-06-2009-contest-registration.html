title: 2009 Contest Registration
---
<p>Registration for the <a href="http://railsrumble.com">2009 Rails Rumble</a> is now open. Go <a href="http://r09.railsrumble.com">sign up</a> to reserve a spot for your team now! As we <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/2009/6/30/2009-contest-kickoff">mentioned previously</a>, registering to compete will require a minimum donation of $5.00 per team to one of the eligible community projects we&#8217;ve selected. This year, those projects include our friends at <a href="http://railsbridge.com">RailsBridge</a>, the <a href="http://ruby19orbust.com">Ruby 1.9 or Bust!</a> project, and the Rails Rumble organizers team (hey, that&#8217;s us!)</p><p>We have 150 guaranteed spots available for competing teams and registration for those spots will remain open for contestants until the 12th of July or until they run out, whichever comes first. We may be able to open some additional spots if we need to but there are no guarantees. So yeah, don&#8217;t miss out! If you just want to participate in judging, you can register as a judge at any time from now through the end of the voting period.</p><p>There are going to be some great prizes this year, thanks to our <a href="/sponsors">sponsors</a>, and we expect the quality of the applications to be higher than ever before. We&#8217;re really looking forward to it, and hope you are too.</p>
