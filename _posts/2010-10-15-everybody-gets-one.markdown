What would a Rumble organization team be without some last minute tips! We want to see everybody do well, so keep these tidbits in mind:

- Deploy early and often: remember, if users can give you feedback before the time's up, you can address those blind spots!

- Sleep. Doctors say that sleep is good. We tend to agree.

- Be merry! Come hang out with us all in IRC. Remember, this is a friendly competition, not a cutthroat one.

But here are some resources to help you get off to a fantastic start:

- Tyler Bird's excellent two-part screencast series on Rails Rumble server and deployment setup. It's so good, we really ought to be paying him! <a href="http://www.filmprog.com/2010/10/15/rails-rumble-server-screencasts/">check it out!</a>

- Linode suggests leveraging <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/blog/2010/10/11/speed-up-with-stackscripts">StackScripts</a>, and the MadRails group even created one specifically for the Rumble. Be sure to check it out!

- We've actually got people waiting to help you if you get stuck. Head on over to the <a href="/guardians">Rumble Guardians</a> page and take a look &mdash; these fine developers are ready and waiting in IRC to help you with anything you need. They won't write code for you, but consider them your phone-a-friend for the duration of the event!

Here's wishing you the best of luck!
