<p>Whoah, registration numbers and your donations have definitely exceeded our expectations this year. In under 5 days we&#8217;ve received more than 150 registrations for the competition and they just keep coming. Nice work!</p><p>So instead of waitlisting a bunch of teams like we did last year, we went ahead and asked our infrastructure partners at <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> if maybe &#8212; just maybe &#8212; they wouldn&#8217;t mind us going to 200 teams this year. And they said <em>yes</em>! Because they&#8217;re full of awesome. (thanks guys!)</p><p>There are still a couple days left, and about 40 of the 50 expanded team spots are still available, so keep spreading the word and let&#8217;s fill em up. Registration will still be closing end of day Sunday.</p>
