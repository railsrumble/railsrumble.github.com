title: Two Hour Warning
---
<p>This is just a quick note to our contestants to let them know that they should start wrapping things up. The contest will end exactly at midnight <span class="caps">UTC</span>, which is only about two hours from now.</p><p>Make sure that you have finished committing and pushing all of your code before this time, and have deployed the version of your code tagged with the &#8216;railsrumble09&#8217; identifier. Please review the <a href="http://bit.ly/CKZ3w">pre-competition notes</a> and the <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/rules">official rules</a> and make sure you have verified your submission using the tools on your Rails Rumble team profile. Our advice is to do this early, in order to make sure you have time to correct any last minute oversights!</p><p>After the competition closes, you will have a time window of six hours in which to finish modifying your team profile. You should make sure to fill out all the relevant fields, including the resources you&#8217;ve used in your project (this is very important, you <strong>must</strong> list any and all tools and libraries you&#8217;ve used!), uploading an appealing screenshot, and providing an optional screencast or <span class="caps">URL</span> for more information.</p><p>If you have any questions or problems, you can reach us via the #railsrumble channel in Freenode <span class="caps">IRC</span>, via our <a href="http://support.railsrumble.com">Tender support system</a> or by email at organizers at railsrumble.com. Note that if you get in touch with us <strong>after</strong> the submission deadline, we will not be able to help you.</p><p>Thanks, and best of luck on the final stretch of your Rails Rumble build weekend!</p>
