---

<img class="pull-left" src="/images/2012/10/railsrumble-wrestler-small-500.png"/>

After a week of open registration, we're extremely happy to announce that this year, like last, we easily filled up the **500 spots** we made available for teams! They filled up fast, but interest in the Rails Rumble didn't stop there! A ton of teams came later in the week and were placed on our waiting list.

So what happens next? As you know, the competition starts on October 19th at 00:00 UTC &mdash; you have until then to add members to your team, combine teams, change teams, or drop out. But don't wait until the last minute, get in there and get it done.

## Something Come up? No Longer Able to Compete? Drop Out!

Spots are a precious commodity! They're in limited supply! Teams are on the wait list hoping to get yours! If you have a reserved spot and can no longer compete, **please leave your team so a team from the wait list can have your spot**. To do this, sign in via GitHub at [railsrumble.com](http://railsrumble.com), click your account button at the top, and click "Team Dashboard". From your team's dashboard, just click the "Leave" link next to your name. If you're the last member of the team, your team will be deleted and your spot will be given to the next team on the wait list.

## Invite Members to Your Team

You can add up to three other people to your team, so long as you do it before the competition starts. To do this, sign in via GitHub at [railsrumble.com](http://railsrumble.com), click your account button at the top, and click "Team Dashboard". From your team's dashboard, you'll be able to invite others to your team.

## Ditch Your Friends & Switch Teams

If you have a team of your own or are already on a team, you can leave yours and join another before the competition starts. To do this, sign in via GitHub at [railsrumble.com](http://railsrumble.com), click your account button at the top, and click "Team Dashboard". From your team's dashboard, just click the "Leave" link next to your name. If you're the last member of the team, your team will be deleted and your spot will be given to the next team on the wait list.

## Official Code of Conduct

We'd also like to take this opportunity to point you to our official [Code of Conduct](/conduct). We expect everyone to be respectful in IRC, on Twitter, and on comments left on entry pages. If you find someone in violation of our Code of Conduct, please do not hesitate to email help @ railsrumble.com so that the organizers can deal with it.

## See You Soon!

We'll be emailing everyone later in the week with additional details regarding Linode and GitHub access &mdash; Linode access will be available about 6 hours before the competition and GitHub access will be available when the competition starts. And again, the competition starts promptly on October 19th at 00:00 UTC.
