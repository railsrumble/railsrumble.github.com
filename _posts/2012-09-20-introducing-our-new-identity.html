<p>When I was tasked with the new design for the Rails Rumble, I knew I had to make something different and totally badass. I also knew the logo was very important. So I commissioned my very good friend, and maker of all the logos I use, <a href="http://twitter.com/hamrick">Ryan Hamrick</a>. Ryan is an incredibly talented young illustrator from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania who specializes in beautiful type work.</p>

<p>You can see his work, not only on this site, but on his <a href="http://dribbble.com/hamrick">Dribbble</a> and in his <a href="http://ryanhamrick.com">portfolio</a>. You may also be interested in watching the following video Ryan did for The Artist Series at <a href="http://holstee.com">Holstee</a>:</p>

<p>If you like what you see, <a href="http://twitter.com/hamrick">follow</a> him on Twitter and let him know your gratitude for helping create an even better Rails Rumble this year!</p>

<p>I've also spent some time 3Difying his work and creating a desktop background.</p>
