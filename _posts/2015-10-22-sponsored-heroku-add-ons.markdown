title: "Heroku Add-ons FTW"
---

As you know, we've partnered up with [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/ruby?c=70130000001x9MS) as our infrastructure sponsor again this year. But what you might not have realized is that you'll be able to leverage a ton of [Heroku Add-ons](https://elements.heroku.com/addons) in your app! Most add-ons have a free tier, but, like last year, Heroku wanted to give you access to even more, so they'll be making the first paid tier free for a number of add-ons (see below) during the competition.

Once the competition starts, you'll be able to install these Heroku sponsored add-ons, right from your team's dashboard here on [railsrumble.com](http://railsrumble.com). It'll look something like this:
