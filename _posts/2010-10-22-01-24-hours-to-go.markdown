Just a quick reminder: <strong>voting ends tomorrow night at midnight GMT (8:00PM
EST)</strong>. That's just a little more than 24 hours from now! Thanks to everyone
who's shown up to vote and helped us spread the word. The top scoring apps are
all pretty close together at the moment, and there's still plenty of time for
shakeups to happen.

So if you haven't already,
<a href="http://railsrumble.com">check out the current leaderboard</a> and
<a href="http://railsrumble.com/login">sign up for an account</a> so you can
judge some entries. We're really looking forward to seeing who your favorites
are.

PS we just got a real nice article over at
<a href="http://tcrn.ch/96ilW2">TechCrunch</a> highlighting some of their
favorite apps. Sweet.
