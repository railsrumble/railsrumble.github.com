title: Tropo Challenge Winner
---

This year in addition to the main competition, we had four special
<a href="/challenges">sponsor challenges</a> that teams could opt-in for.
Over the next week or so, we'll be announcing the winners of those challenges,
hand selected by the sponsors.

We're happy to report that the first of these special awards goes to our
friends at <a href="http://instalover.r10.railsrumble.com">Instalover</a> for
their SMS-based instant blind dating app. Instalover was chosen by
<a href="http://tropo.com">Tropo</a> for the <a href="/challenges/voice">"Best Use of Real-Time
Communications"</a> category and the team members are getting some sweet Sonos S5
Music systems for their efforts.
