<p>Hello Rumblers,</p><p>It&#8217;s that time of the year again &#8211; The RailsRumble is almost upon us.In less than 48 hours, The 2008 competition will start. At 00:00 <span class="caps">GMT</span>,October 18th (that is, as it turns midnight on the Friday / Saturdaycoming), we&#8217;ll let the gates open for everyone to compete.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are a few things you&#8217;ll need to do first ifyou are competing (If not, you can safely ignore this email).</p><p>As you likely know already, Linode is once again providing a <span class="caps">VPS</span>for each team to use for the competition and GitHub will also beproviding private repositories for each team.</p><p>If you haven&#8217;t already, you&#8217;ll need to log in to the rumble application(at http://railsrumble/) and follow two steps.</p><pre><code>1) Edit your user profile and fill in the "GitHub username field" if   you will be contributing code / want access to the git repository.   We need you to do this as soon as possible for the competition to go   smoothly.</code></pre><pre><code>2) Edit your team's profile to a) check the box agreeing to Linode's   Terms of Service (if you don't do this, you wont be able to access   your VPS during the competition) as well as making sure your information   is up to date and ready to go.</code></pre><p>Once that is done, you&#8217;ll be good to go.</p><p>We&#8217;d also just like to give a big shout out to all the awesome sponsorswho make this possible. This year, we&#8217;ve teamed up to include some coolservices in addition to the awesome prizes!</p><p>If you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, We&#8217;ve teamed up with RunCodeRun for super-awesomecontinuous integration (although access will be limited to 100 teams &#8211; see thepost at http://blog.railsrumble.com/2008/10/15/see-code-run-run-code-run formore information).</p><p>In case you haven&#8217;t seen them yet, the aforementioned awesome prizes have alsojust been posted on the site at http://blog.railsrumble.com/prizes</p><p>Lastly, if you haven&#8217;t yet joined the #railsrumble <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel (on freenode),we suggest you do so. Not only will we let you know when things happen in thelead up to the competition start, we&#8217;ll also be around to help during the entirecompetition.
