title: The Wait is Over
---
<p>  Well, Kind of. We've just moved the 30 odd teams that were on the wait list to the competitors list  and we've managed to open up 10 more time limited spots. What this means for you is that if you  were wait listed before, you should've gotten an email letting you know you've been accepted. If you haven't signed  up yet, registration closes in roughly a day so be quick.</p>
