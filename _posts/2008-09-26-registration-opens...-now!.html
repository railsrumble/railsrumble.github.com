<p>Registration is now open. There are 200 seats available, and it&#8217;s first come first serve. <a href="http://app.railsrumble.com">Sign up now</a>!</p><p>If the seats don&#8217;t all fill up before then, we&#8217;ll be cutting off registration on the 10th of October in order to make final preparations. If you&#8217;re still on the fence, looking for team members or project ideas, we invite you to visit #railsrumble on the Freenode <span class="caps">IRC</span> network.</p>
