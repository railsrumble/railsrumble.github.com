<p>Hey there, and welcome to the 2008 Rails Rumble.</p><p>For those of you who weren&#8217;t involved last year, the Rumble is a 48 hour design/develop/deploy competition. Basically, you get one weekend to exploit the awesome power of <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> to create and launch the best web-based application that you can. Then, the general public gets to vote for the best by rating them in a number of different categories&#8212;design/aesthetics, completeness, uniqueness, and overall usefulness. The winners get some pretty great prizes, thanks to our sponsors (who will be announced shortly).</p><p>Oh yeah, it&#8217;s also a lot of fun . . . Really! Think of the event as a miniature startup incubator, and use it as an excuse to deliver a v1 of that idea you&#8217;ve been sitting on for 6 months. Or, if you&#8217;re new to Rails, use it as an excuse to test drive a new technology and see just how far you can get with it in a very constrained timeframe.</p><p>This year, the Rumble will be happening over the weekend of <b>October 18th and 19th</b>. Note those dates, as they&#8217;re different than the originally projected/tentative dates that were mentioned for September. They&#8217;ve been updated so as to not interfere with other Ruby-related conferences and events.</p><p>Registration will open shortly. We&#8217;re currently working with our two primary event partners, <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, to determine the number of seats that will be available for the contest this year. More information about that, and many other event-related details, is coming very soon. Stay tuned! If you use a news reader, make sure to subscribe to <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/feed">our feed</a>. Registration, sponsors, prizes, and other information will be posted here first!</p>
