title: Finalists and Public Voting
---
Our spectacular <a href="/expert-panel">panel of experts</a> are finished with their
duties (thanks for all the hard work, guys and gals!), and the 2010 Rails Rumble
<a href="http://railsrumble.com/entries">finalists</a> have been announced.
Go take a look, and if you haven't already,
<a href="http://railsrumble.com/login">sign up for an account</a> and help us
decide which of these entries will be our winner this year.

Now that public voting has officially begun, teams that didn't make the
final round and who aren't participating in a sponsor challenge can once
again start pushing updates to their live sites. We know that
many of you have been waiting for that opportunity, and we can't wait to see
where you take your project from here. Remember: building a successful web
property isn't a sprint, it's a marathon.

Just to be double super extra clear, please note that if you opted in to a
<a href="/challenges">special sponsor challenge</a>, we
ask that you hold off on further updates even if you didn't make the top tier.
Sponsors will be making their decisions after public voting closes and the
main competition winners are announced, and it'd be unfair for some
applications to be able to update while others (that did make it into the top
tier) are forbidden from doing that. Don't worry, it's just a couple more
days!

That's it for now. Go get your vote on and be merry. Thanks again to our
experts, event sponsors, and most of all to everyone who spent last weekend
hacking with us. You all rock.
