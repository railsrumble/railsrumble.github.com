title: It All Starts... Soon
---

I just checked my watch and it looks like there are less than 3 hours until
the official start of the 2010 Rails Rumble competition weekend. Damn, that's
crazy. Crazy, I say!

Everyone who is competing should now have an updated team profile that lists their
Linode and GitHub access information. You may select the distro for your
Linode at this point but please do not push any code to GitHub before the
official start of the event or you will be disqualified. Srsly. Also, please
refrain from renaming  a repo or changing collaborating teams.

As a reminder, the competition officially starts at 12:00 GMT (midnight). We
can't wait to see what you come up with. In the meantime, you've got 3 hours
to chill, plan, prepare your feast of snacks and energy drinks, or whatever
else it is you need to do. We recommend eating. Because eating is awesome. But
take it easy on the candy, k?

If you need help during the event, you can file tickets with our
<a href="http://support.railsrumble.com">helpdesk</a>, or hop into the
\#railsrumble IRC channel on Freenode.

Good luck! You'll be hearing from us again soon.
