Damn, that&#8217;s a lot of 48-hour micro-apps. They&#8217;ve got their work cut out for them, that&#8217;s for sure.</p><p>Anyway, assuming that all goes to schedule, our finalists should be announced sometime Thursday &#8212; probably in the evening &#8212; and public voting will then commence and continue throughout the end of the week and into the weekend. It&#8217;s gonna be a nail-biter!</p><p>In the meantime, check out our updated <a href="http://r09.railsrumble.com">competition homepage</a> which features rotating site snapshots and statistics from the contest.</p>
