The <a href="/challenges">special sponsor challenges</a> we teased about are now live!
Check them out and let us know what you think. We think they're pretty great.
But hey, we're biased.

We should stress that these challenges are sort of like mini-contests within a
contest. They have their own judging criteria and prizes, but also require
adherence to all the normal Rumble rules (48 hours, etc etc). Participating in
a challenge match will not affect your chances of winning the main competition
in any way. However, if you do opt to compete in one of them, there are some
fantastic dev opportunities and prizes to be had. Maybe we should have called
them bonus rounds, right?

Here are the first three. A special fourth challenge should be announced
in the very near future.

* <a href="/challenges/twitter">Oneforty and Compass Labs Challenge: Best Use of the Twitter API</a>
* <a href="/challenges/monetize">Chargify Challenge: Most Potential to Monetize</a>
