title: Let The Judging (Officially) Begin!
---

The judging portion of the 2012 Rails Rumble has officially started! Please take some time over the next three days (judging ends on October 18th at 23:59 UTC), to [browse through the 300 completed entries](http://railsrumble.com/entries/all) and pick your favorites. When you're done finding the ones you like the best, go to the [favorites section](http://railsrumble.com/entries/favorites) and get it down to your top ten, put them in order, and click the finalize button to lock in your picks!

*Note: Participants and public judges aren't required to lock in their picks, but if they do, their top ten will appear on their profile page after the winners are announced.*

As a public judge or participant, you'll be making your picks alongside our incredible panel of [expert judges](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2012/10/12/meet-the-expert-judges/). Expert judges will be deciding the top 1 through 10 winners and who'll be getting the "Best Solo" award, while public judges and participants will be determining who gets the "Public Favorite" award.

Oh, you didn't realize there were prizes? Well, there are. [Serious ones!](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2012/10/13/prizes-prizes-prizes/)

Lastly, we urge you to leave feedback for the competitors. What did you love about their app? What didn't you love? How can they make it better? How brilliant was their app? Competitors love feedback, so send it their way!
