<p><a href="http://www.stickermule.com/"><img src="/images/2010/10/stickermule_150.png" width="150" height="150" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" /></a>We are super pleased to announce that our friends at <a href="http://www.stickermule.com">Sticker Mule</a> have just shipped official 2010 Rails Rumble stickers to all teams that opted in to receive awesome free stuff from our awesome sponsors!  Made from heavy duty (6 mil) vinyl with awesome high-definition printing; these babies are designed to resist fading <strong>and</strong> beer spills &mdash; not that you'd ever drink beer and code. ;-)</p>

<p>Even better, <a href="http://www.stickermule.com/">Sticker Mule</a> is including a $25 coupon on the back of each sticker good for your next order.  Promote your business, OSS project, event, or just wow your friends with some <a href="http://www.stickermule.com/t/categories/custom-stickers">custom stickers</a> or <a href="http://www.stickermule.com/t/categories/custom-skins">skins</a>.</p>

<p>And we want to see lots of Rumblers sporting Rumble stickers on our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/rumble2010/">Flickr group</a>.  Don't be shy, just ask to join and we'll let you in.</p>
