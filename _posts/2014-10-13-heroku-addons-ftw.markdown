title: "Sponsored Heroku Add-ons - Collect 'Em All!"
---

As you know, this year we partnered up with [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/ruby?c=70130000001x9MS), as our infrastructure sponsor. But what you might not have realized is, this means you can use [every single Add-On Heroku has](https://addons.heroku.com), during the competition. Most Add-ons have a free tier, but Heroku didn't want to stop there. They wanted you to be able to build the best entries possible, and they didn't want anything holding you back. So they reached out to a bunch of great services, and asked them to make their first tier paid plans free during the competition, as well.

Once the competition starts, you'll be able to install these sponsored add-ons right from your team's dashboard here on [railsrumble.com](http://railsrumble.com). It'll look something like this:
