title: Introducing Our Experts
---
<p>Wow, so there&#8217;s only one week left until the build portion of the competition starts. Things sure do move fast, right? We&#8217;re obviously pretty excited and we hope you are too. There are well over 200 teams competing in the event this year and we can&#8217;t wait to see what they come up with.</p><p>As mentioned <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/2009/6/30/2009-contest-kickoff">previously</a>, judging is going to work a bit differently this year because there are so many entries. We&#8217;ve hand-picked a group of <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/judges/expert-panel">pretty awesome expert judges</a> who are going to help us trim down the list of finished applications to just the best of the best, all American Idol-style. Then you, the public, are going to get to vote on the top tier (those that move on to the next round) and ultimately determine the winners.</p><p>Our <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/judges/expert-panel">2009 expert panel</a> includes people who do great stuff from all sectors of the web development and startup world: we have web developers, designers, user experience experts, startup and venture business folks, and media people involved. And some former Rumble winners too.</p><p>Each of these brave souls will be judging a number of entries, rating them in categories such as design, innovation, completeness, and usefulness, and leaving personal comments or advice for contestants. We&#8217;re really glad they agreed to do this, as it&#8217;s no trivial amount of work on their part. If you&#8217;re a contestant, I&#8217;d take this opportunity to welcome them to the fold and say some nice things ;-). Maybe send a fruit basket or something.</p>
