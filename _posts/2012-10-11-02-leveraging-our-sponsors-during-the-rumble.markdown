In addition to Linode & GitHub, who [we told you about earlier today](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2012/10/11/linode-up-and-running-with-stackscripts/), we have a ton of other [amazing sponsors](http://railsrumble.com) this year. If you haven't already seen them, go have a look!

Back? Okay then, let us tell you about how you can leverage a number of our amazing sponsors during the Rails Rumble itself. Many have special offers, just for you!

### Design with [Divshot](http://divshot.com)

[Divshot](http://divshot.com) is a brand new, drag-and-drop, interface builder. With Divshot, you can quickly build, design, and export a beautiful, responsive layout, that's built on Bootstrap. After the competition starts, you're welcome to use Divshot for your app, so go sign up!

### Grids with [Gridset](https://gridsetapp.com)

Need to design a fully responsive grid system? Look no further than [Gridset](https://gridsetapp.com)! Gridset is as easy as dragging guides in Photoshop and exports beautiful CSS, ready to use in your app. To use Gridset **for free** during the weekend of the 2012 Rails Rumble, check the "special offers" section in your team's dashboard. They've even provided a 50% off coupon if you'd like to keep using Gridset on your other projects for another month. And really, why wouldn't you?

### Learn with [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com)

The clock is ticking, you only have 24 hours left, and you... you... forget how to implement tagging? Don't worry! Head over to [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com), brush up with a quick how-to video from Ryan, and get back to your coffee without losing a step. Just try not to get engrossed in the mountains of amazing content while you're over there. Wait until after the competition for that!

### Email with [Mandrill](http://mandrill.com)

Email doesn't have to be hard. In fact, it can be easy! With [Mandrill](http://mandrill.com), a brand new transactional email service from MailChimp, you can quickly integrate with your Rails app, start sending HTML email, and painlessly track opens and clicks in no time. Your send limit will even automatically scale up as your send more email.

### Plan with [Sprint.ly](http://sprint.ly)

Create stories, tasks, and bugs with [Sprint.ly](http://sprint.ly) and don't miss a beat this weekend! Sprint.ly's unique, ridiculously useful, real-time updating dashboard, lets all of your team's members keep your planning in sync. Something need fixing? Create a defect! Think of a feature?

### Test with [tddium](http://tddium.com)

### Measure with [New Relic](http://newrelic.com)

### React with [Honeybadger](http://honeybadger.io)

### Monitor with [PagerDuty](http://pagerduty.com)

What happens when you build an incredible app for the Rails Rumble and after the competition, your entire team passes out from exhaustion without realizing that your site turned off and judges can't see your app? Well, that shouldn't have happened! Do yourself a favor: set up [PagerDuty](http://pagerduty.com) and catch some z's knowing they'll watch over things for you and ring your phone if something goes wrong.

### Track with [GoSquared](https://www.gosquared.com)

You've designed your app, you've planned everything, you've tested, you've deployed, you've measured performance. You might be asking: "What's left?" Real-time analytics of course! Head over to your team's dashboard, get your 3-months-free coupon for [GoSquared](https://www.gosquared.com), and watch your site's traffic unfold while you recover from your caffeine overdose.

## So, Will You Be Ready?

All of these amazing services offer a free way for you to take them for a spin this weekend, some with special coupons in your team's dashboard. So take a few minutes before the competition and get yourself signed up for all of them! They'll be a huge help, not only this weekend, but for every app you develop from here on out.
