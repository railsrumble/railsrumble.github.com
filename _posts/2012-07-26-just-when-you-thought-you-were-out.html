<p>The 2012 Rails Rumble pulled you back in!</p>

<p>We're extremely pleased to announce that the 2012 Rails Rumble is finally, officially, official. Don't believe us? Well, that's your loss, because everyone else will be marking their calendars for <strong>October 12th through the 14th</strong>!</p>

<p>Rails Rumble, the original 48-hour challenge that gives developers a chance to show off what they can accomplish in, well, 48 hours, is going to be better than ever this year. We're just happy we've never called it an annual competition. That would have been awkward.</p>

<p>But wait, you're new to the Rails Rumble? You don't know what this is all about? Well you've been missing out! Imagine this (stolen verbatim from 2010 announcement post):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a Friday evening (for most of us), you sit at your computer, with up to three of your closest friends nearby, when suddenly your Twitter stream starts flooding! Your IRC windows start flashing by! Your friends start clicking rapidly on their own machines! "Itâ€™s up!" one of them yells.</p>

  <p>You have forty-eight hours, up to three friends, a shared Git repository, a remote server, and Rails (or your favorite Rack-based framework). From that point on, it's up to you - to design, develop, and deploy the greatest web application the world has ever seen!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also have a huge surprise for everyone: a completely revamped judging system! We'll be talking about this in more detail as we get closer to registration. We've thought long and hard (I mean, we had a whole extra year) and think we've come up with something really special. It's going to revolutionize judging, and stuff. It's easier, less weird, more exciting - there's nothing it can't do!<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Now on a more serious note, we'd like to take a moment to thank our wonderful infrastructure sponsors: <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. They've generously offered to sponsor servers and Git repositories again this year, which makes this whole shindig possible. Thanks Linode and GitHub!</p>

<p>So, you're still reading, huh? Well cut it out! You should have already closed this tab and started IM'ing or texting (or whatever the kids are doing these days) to get your friends on-board. And after that, you should start thinking about what incredible, amazing thing you want to build when October rolls around. Well, that's it. Keep your eyes peeled for the "Registration Is Now Open" post and don't forget to tell everyone: "The Rumble Is Back!"</p>
