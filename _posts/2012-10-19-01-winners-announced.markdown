The winners of 2012 Rails Rumble have been announced, so <a href="http://railsrumble.com/entries/winners">go check them out</a>!

Winners will be receiving a number of [awesome prizes](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2012/10/13/prizes-prizes-prizes/) from our sponsors (thanks, sponsors!), and all teams that made it into the judging round will be receiving 2012 Rails Rumble stickers courtesy of [Sticker Mule](http://stickermule.com). Additionally, many of our sponsors have provided coupons for their services that you can get from your team's dashboard.

Teams, you should now feel free to deploy any updates you have waiting in the wings. We'll email you soon with a quick survey and details regarding your [Linode](http://linode.com) server and [GitHub](http://github.com) repository. And if you won, you'll also be hearing from us with details on how to get your prizes.

Thanks to everyone for being a part of the 2012 Rails Rumble!
