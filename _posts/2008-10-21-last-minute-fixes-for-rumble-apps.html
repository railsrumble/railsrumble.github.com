title: Last Minute Fixes for Rumble Apps
---
<p>Due to overwhelming demand, we&#8217;ve decided to givecontestants one last chance to fix any show stopperbugs (similar to last year). Because we want to getvoting open as soon as possible, there are a fewconditions on this.</p><p>Firstly, you&#8217;ll be allowed to change up to 10 linesfrom the railsrumble tag. If you didn&#8217;t get thetag in on time <span class="caps">BUT</span> your code was relatively completebefore hand &#8211; you can also use the last commit made before 00:00(but please note, in this case you will need to let us know).</p><p>For this to work smoothly, we&#8217;re giving you until23:59GMT on the 21st &#8211; that is, Midnight, Tuesdaynight <span class="caps">GMT</span>.</p><p>If you do this, you&#8217;ll then need to tag this newchange (note: only 1 commit is allowed) as &#8220;railsrumble-fix&#8221; and then email organizers@railsrumble.comwith the subject &#8220;Fixed Release&#8221; telling us your teamname as well as a link to the tag on github.(once that&#8217;s done, we&#8217;ll check your deployed version &#8211; if you&#8217;renot changing it, an email letting us know would be goodas well).</p><p>So in summary, you&#8217;ve got until 23:59GMT to submit a singlecommit with up to 10 lines changed (so, either 10 unique adds/ deletes OR one line changed). To prepare do this (assumingyou&#8217;ve tagged it), you can do the following:</p><pre><code>git checkout railsrumble</code></pre><p>Which will checkout the railsrumble tag &#8211; verifying you&#8217;reat the correct starting revision. Then, make your changes.You can type &#8220;git diff&#8221; to get a diff of your changes. Onceyou&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re made a correct amount (0 to 10), you cancommit and push your changes by doing the following:</p><pre><code>git commit -a -m "Modifications to correct railsrumble" git tag railsrumble-fixgit pushgit push --tags</code></pre><p>Note that we only intend you to use this commit to fix anyshow stopper bugs &#8211; e.g. a 500 on your login page, somethingpreventing people from logging in and the like.</p><p><strong>edit</strong>: Please redeploy your app as well, changing the:branch option in your capistrano file (if used) torailsrumble-fix</p><p>Thanks, &mdash; The RailsRumble Team</p>
