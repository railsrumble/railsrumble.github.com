title: "Teams - You've Made It!"
---

Congratulations, teams! You've made it to the end of the competition portion of the 2014 Rails Rumble!

**Remember:**

* If you completed an app, you're a judge!
* You must mark all 5 verification steps as completed in your team's dashboard to qualify for judging.
* Do not deploy any new code or make any modifications to your app of any kind or you'll be disqualified.
* It's okay to continue pushing code to GitHub, but be careful and **do not push to Heroku**.

In about 24 hours, we'll be opening the judging portion of the competition. At that time, you'll be able to [pick and finalize your own favorite entries](http://railsrumble.com/entries/all), which will decide [this year's winnerers](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2014/10/03/prizes-prizes-prizes/). We also strongly encourage you to leave feedback for other teams. Everyone put in a ton of hard work this weekend, so please take some time over the next week, while you're recuperating, to take a look at the other entries and let them know how they did.

After everyone finishes picking their favorites this week and winners are announced, your accumulated points will be privately visible to you in your team's dashboard.

As always, please email [help@railsrumble.com](mailto:help@railsrumble.com) with any questions you may have.

Now go get some rest, you deserve it!
