title: Teams - You've Made It!
---

The competition period of the 2012 Rails Rumble is officially over. Phew! Wipe that sweat from your brow, remove the leftover pizza from your shirt, text your loved ones to tell them you're still alive, grab a beer and chill.

There was an amazing turnout this year and although running the Rails Rumble is a lot of work, you all make it incredibly worth it. The fact we had so many entries, impressed us to no end. Now that we've finished and have seen everyone's hard work come to fruition, it just impresses us even more!

The Judging period is next. It'll be from the 16th through the 18th. However, feel free to start [favouriting and sharing the apps you enjoy](http://railsrumble.com/entries/all). Don't forget to leave any comments you feel could help the teams. They all put in a lot of hard work, so let them know they did well!

If there are any Rumblers with questions still, then feel free to [contact us](http://railsrumble.com/contact) and we'll get back to you as quickly as possible.

I think it's time we all got a lot of sleep now. Goodnight!
