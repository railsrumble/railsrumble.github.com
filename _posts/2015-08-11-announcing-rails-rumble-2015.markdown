After the success of last year's Rails Rumble, we're extremely happy to welcome back the one and only [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/ruby?c=70130000001x9MS)!

The 2015 Rails Rumble will take place on the weekend of **November 7th & 8th**.

* Registration: Oct. 26th - Nov. 4th
* Competition: Nov. 7th - Nov. 8th

## Ruby++

Every year we get questions about using other technologies, in addition to Ruby, in your entry, so we just wanted to take a brief moment and expand on this. Despite our name, the Rails Rumble is a hackathon for apps built, at least partially, with Ruby. You may be using Rails, Sinatra, or another Rack-based Ruby web framework for both the front and backend. On the other hand, you may build the entire backend API of your app with Rails, and your frontend with Ember.js, Backbone.js, or AngularJS! Either way, we don't discriminate!

## Heroku

If you aren't familiar with Heroku, they provide services and tools that let you focus on building apps, without worrying about infrastructure. You can have your app deployed in minutes and easily scale it to support millions of users. Give them a try by heading over to their site and [creating a free account](https://signup.heroku.com/ruby?c=70130000001x9MS).

## Heroku Add-Ons & Sponsors

After hearing from so many competitors about how they loved the ease of integrated Heroku add-ons last year, many of our sponsors again this year will be available during the competition, free of charge, using Heroku's ridiculously powerful [add-on system](https://addons.heroku.com/?c=70130000001x9MS).

Over the coming months, we'll be announcing even more sponsors, in addition to [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/ruby?c=70130000001x9MS), so if you have a product or service that'd you'd like smart, young, intelligent, thoughtful, developers and designers, from around the world to check out, [please let us know](http://railsrumble.com/sponsors/new).

## Judging

Because of another success of last year's competition, our judging revamp, we're very happy to announce that judging for this year's Rumble will be once again in the hands of the community. If you ship an app, you'll be considered a judge!

Furthermore, each team will again see exactly how many points they received, privately in their team's dashboard, while points for winning teams will be displayed publicly.

## Job Board

The last thing we'd like to mention is the [Rails Rumble Job Board](http://railsrumble.com/jobs) is back again. If have an opening, and want to support the Rails Rumble, please consider checking it out.

## &lt;/announcement&gt;
