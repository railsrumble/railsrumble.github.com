title: Pencils Down!

It's been a crazy 48 hours. And from what we've seen so far, a very
_productive_ 48 hours. We've been blown away by some of the entries we've seen
so far, and we think that our judges will be too. In fact, we can't wait to
review them all.

### Wrapping Up

Please make sure to completely fill out your team / entry profiles. If you
haven't already, include a short, concise description of your application and
the resources you used when creating it. You have the next 24 hours to wrap
this up (but the sooner you do it, the better). Don't make any code changes
from this point forward. If you do, you will be disqualified. You may log into
your Linode to restart a stuck process or access your Rails console of course,
but the code deployed on your box must match the final tag you deployed.

As one final reminder, you need to tag the final version of your code with the
word '<strong>rumble10</strong>' and push those tags up to GitHub. If you need help with this,
check
<a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/blog/2010/10/16/02-were-halfway-there">this
blog post.</a> The version of your app deployed to production must
match the tagged code. Git tags are locked down for reals at 10 past, and then
that's that. Verification will be finalized one hour from now and at that
point, teams that don't pass verification will be disqualified.

### Judging Starts... Soon

Over the next few hours we'll be verifying entries and getting things prepared
for our <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/expert-panel">expert panel</a>
judging round. We may get in touch with you if we have
questions. Once expert judging begins, our experts will be rating your
applications on a scale of 1-5 in four different categories and leaving you
constructive feedback. Feel free to engage them in conversation. They love
that sort of thing.

After they finish, the highest rated entries will go on to the public judging
round. Regardless of whether or not your entry is selected for that, we hope
you'll continue to stay involved Wednesday through Friday by voting on the top
tier applications and helping us decide the winner of Rails Rumble 2010.

Thanks again for your dedication and hard work, and good luck during judging!
