title: rbDB is Open Sourced
---
<p>Ivan Schneider emailed us a while back to let us know that his team had decided to open-source their Rumble app, <a href="http://railsrumble.com/teams/mbg">rbDB</a>. A serious contender for the &#8216;most useful&#8217; category this year, rbDB is a <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/2046491">web-based database administration tool</a> similar to the popular phpMyAdmin package. Its developers are still actively working on improving the codebase (currently tagged as an alpha), but you can check it out for yourself and contribute at rbDB&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/redox/rbdb/tree/master">GitHub project page</a>.</p><p>If other Rumble participants have also decided to open-source their apps, let us know, and we&#8217;ll be happy to help spread the word!</p>
