title: Rumble WorkShares Are Go!
---
<p>Last year we ran a program called the Rails Rumble WorkShare. Participating companies opened their doors to local teams and offered free work spaces to use during the 48 hour competition. It was a pretty good time for everyone involved, I think &#8212; teams were able to get together and exchange ideas, network, and compete in person.</p><p><img src="http://blog.railsrumble.com/images/2009/8/13/dog-patch-labs-pier-38_1.jpg" alt="Dog Patch Lab"/></p><p>This year, <a href="http://ryanspoon.com">Ryan Spoon</a> of <a href="http://polarisventures.com">Polaris Ventures</a> has been kind enough to offer up their <a href="http://dogpatchblog.wordpress.com/about/">Dog Patch Lab</a> space at Pier 38 in San Francisco. And our friends at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">Thoughtbot</a> are opening their Boston offices to area teams, too. If you&#8217;re interested in taking advantage of either of these options, please check out the <a href="http://rumble-workshare.wikispaces.com/">Rumble WorkShare wiki</a> for more pictures, details, and <span class="caps">RSVP</span> information.</p><p><img src="http://blog.railsrumble.com/images/2009/8/13/3352344178_bd462681c2.jpg" alt="Thoughtbot"/></p><p>Do you represent a company who is interested in offering your work space to local teams?
