title: "Teams - You've Made It!"
---

Congratulations, teams! You've made it to the end of the competition portion of the 2013 Rails Rumble!

**Remember:**

* Mark all verification steps in your team's dashboard as completed to qualify for judging.
* Do not deploy any new code or make any modifications to your server's deploy directory or config files of any kind or you'll be disqualified.

In about 24 hours, we'll be opening the three day long judging portion of the competition. At that time, we'll be revealing this year's expert judges and you'll be able to [pick and finalize your own favorite entries](http://railsrumble.com/entries/all), which will decide the [public favorite award](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2013/10/04/omg-prizes/). We also strongly encourage you to leave feedback for other teams. Everyone put in a ton of hard work this weekend, so please take some time over the next few days, while you're recuperating, to take a look at the other entries and let them know how they did.

As always, please email [help@railsrumble.com](mailto:help@railsrumble.com) with any questions you may have.

Now go get some rest, you deserve it!
