<p>Our friends JP Toto and Sara Chipps have put together a 48-hour innovation competition called <a href="http://www.mvcmelee.com/"><span class="caps">MVC</span> Melee</a> that brings the spirit of the Rails Rumble to Microsoft web app developers. If you&#8217;re a .NET nerd, you should definitely check this out. Looks like it&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun!</p>
