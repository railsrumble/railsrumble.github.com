The winners of 2013 Rails Rumble have been announced, so [go check them out](http://railsrumble.com/entries/winners)!

Winners will be receiving a number of [awesome prizes from our sponsors](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2013/10/04/omg-prizes/), like gift certificates and free access to services (thanks, sponsors)!

Teams, you should now feel free to deploy any updates you have waiting in the wings. We'll email you soon with a quick survey and details regarding your Linode server and GitHub repository (you'll have both until the November 10th). And if you're in the Top 10, or won the Best Solo or Public Favorite awards, you'll also be hearing from us with details on how to get your prizes.

Thanks to all the [expert judges](http://railsrumble.com/experts), [participants](http://railsrumble.com/participants), and public voters, for taking part in the 2013 Rumble!
