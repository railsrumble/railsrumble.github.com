The last <a href="/challenges">Rails Rumble 2010 Sponsor Challenge</a> has
finally been announced. It's for <a href="/challenges/voice">Best Use of Real-Time
Communication</a> and the category is sponsored by our friends at
<a href="http://tropo.com">Tropo</a>. Want to integrate support for voice /
telephony, SMS, or IM into your Rumble app? Check out Tropo's API (free for
developers) and sign up for the sponsor challenge today by editing your team
profile!

Connecting to your web site's users with voice, SMS, or even IM allows
you to reach them when they aren't at their desks. These real-time
communications mediums are skyrocketing in usage -- who doesn't have a
phone? Thankfully, building an application that works over the phone
or instant messaging is easier than you think.

Telephony has traditionally required complicated hardware and software
or specialized programming languages. In recent years, however, web
programming tools and models ranging from VoiceXML to web services
APIs have made it easy for any developer to create communications
services. In fact, one developer created a complete <a
href="http://github.com/openvoice/">clone of Google Voice using Ruby
on Rails</a> and Tropo in only 14 days.

### An API for your phone number

Have you ever wanted your phone to be answered by your code? When your
friends call, you'd like to pick it up, and when telemarketers call,
youâ€™d like it to go straight to voicemail. Make an automated call to
remind you of an appointment, or even build a conference calling
system. With today's computer telephony you can do all this using only
a few lines of code. You don't even need to install VoIP hardware or
software.

Tropo works by converting phone calls, IMs, and text messages to API
calls that your code works with. An incoming call or message is
delivered to your code and your code tells Tropo what to say back.

### Beyond Voice

Did I just say IMs and Text messages? Yup.

A rising percentage of the population more likely to communicate over
text messaging, IM, and social networks than pick up the phone. APIs
and customer-self service systems must adapt to the preferences of the
customers they want to help.

Over the next decade, 50% of the automated communications that today
happens over the telephone will shift to other mediums. It's important
for the applications you develop to be available on the networks your
users choose to use.

### Try it Yourself

To demonstrate how easy it is to weave voice and text into your
application, let's look at a sample application running on our Tropo
cloud communications platform.

We've created a mashup for the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART) schedules so you can see when the next train is due to arrive
at the station of your choice. Call or SMS (407) 374-9954 to try it.
Outside the US? You can call from Skype (+99000936 9991430523) or SIP
(sip:9991430523@sip.tropo.com) and all Tropo apps can get local
numbers worldwide.

The <a href="https://www.tropo.com/docs/scripting/t_ruby-barteta.htm">code
behind this</a> can sit in Tropo's cloud or on the web server of your
choice. Other sample applications are available covering everything
from simple games to directory assistance, to checking into
Foursquare.
