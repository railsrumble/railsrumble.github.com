title: "Introducing RumbleX!"
---

Tom and Nick Mango here to pass along some fun and exciting news. We're partnering up with Node Knockout and it's organizers, Jacques and Sakina Crocker to form a brand new company called [RumbleX](http://rumblex.com)! You know what that means... MORE HACKATHONS ARE COMING! Sooner than you might think too ðŸ˜€

We also have one more person joining us at RumbleX. Nick Plante, aka NAP, the co-creator of the 48 hour virtual competition structure, and the co-founder of Rails Rumble way back in 2007. Damn, that's so long ago millennials consider it "back in the day".

Keep your eyes peeled because we got some great stuff brewing.

Thanks!
