After looking over the 36 entries for our <a href="/challenges/monetize">"Most Potential to Monetize"</a>
challenge at the Rails Rumble event, we have finally come to a decision.  It was a team effort to decide
on the winner for our challenge.  After going through all of the entries, we had each member of the
Chargify team share their top pick on which entry they thought was most likely to monetize with billing.
It came down to two entries and <a href="http://workrz.r10.railsrumble.com">WORKRZ</a> came out on top as
the winner.

WORKRZ is a casual shift management application that lets you manage and connect your casual employees
online and gives you the ability to instantly see which employees are available to work.  The WORKRZ
application really stood out to us as it had a clear potential to monetize beyond advertising, and well,
it was pretty cool too!

As the winner of the "Chargify: Most Potential to Monetize" challenge, WORKRZ will receive one year free
of Chargify services along with a brand new iPod touch!

We would also like to recognize <a href="http://commendablekids.r10.railsrumble.com">Commendable Kids</a>
as our runner up. Commendable Kids enables you to award children badges for their accomplishments and hard
work, as well as allow others, such as family and friends, to become fans of the child and give them high
fives and encouragement. They were a very close second to WORKRZ and will also receive a year free of
Chargify services.

Thanks everyone who participated in our challenge.  We were very impressed with what you all were able to
come up with in just 48 hours!
