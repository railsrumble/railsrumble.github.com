title: A Message from Linode
---
<p>Our friends at <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a> dropped us a line and asked us to share this with y&#8217;all:</p><p><em><br />Linode is proud to be sponsoring its third consecutive year of Rails Rumble, and looks forward to seeing the innovative entries developed on the Linode platform.</p><p><img src="http://blog.railsrumble.com/images/2009/8/18/linode_badge.png" alt="Linode" style="float: right; padding: 0 0 10px 10px;"/></p><p>For those of you that are new to Linode or Linux administration, get yourself up to speed with the <a href="http://library.linode.com/">Linode Library.</a> The &#8220;Getting Started&#8221; and &#8220;Linode Manager&#8221; categories in the left hand navigation box will have your Linode up and running in no time.</p><p>We&#8217;re excited to continue supporting the Rails and Linux communities, and wish all contestants the best of luck with their entries!</p><p>-The Linode Team<br /></em></p><p>If you&#8217;re competing in the contest and you haven&#8217;t used Linode for <span class="caps">VPS</span> management, you&#8217;re in for a treat. Their dashboard, console, and stats interfaces are easy to use and the service is really top-notch. We&#8217;re not just saying that because they&#8217;re our infrastructure partners, either. If you&#8217;re in the <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel (#railsrumble on the freenode network) during the weekend build event you&#8217;ll no doubt run into some Linode folks. Make sure to say hi to caker, tasaro, mikegrb, and the other staffers!</p><p>PS In addition to the library, there are also some great user-contributed tools to help get you up and running with a Rails stack quickly on Linode. You might want to investigate <a href="http://github.com/opscode/chef/tree/master">Chef</a> (<a href="http://github.com/retr0h/chef_solo_railsrumble/tree/master">rumble recipe</a> by retr0h!) or <a href="http://github.com/hartcode/serverjuice/tree/master">serverjuice</a>. Feel free to add other suggestions in the comments.</p>
