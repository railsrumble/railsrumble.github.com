title: Calling All Sponsors
---
<p>We&#8217;re actively seeking sponsors for the 2009 competition. Sponsor money is used to purchase prizes for winners, and to offset the other costs of running the competition. This year we&#8217;ve created a tiered sponsorship system, with a limited number of sponsored spots available at each level. Supporting the Rumble is a great way to help promote entrepreneurship in the Ruby community. It also allows you to get your company brand, products, and services in front of not just the developer community but also the far larger startup enthusiast and web consumer demographics.</p><p>Make sure to check out our current roster of sponsors, including our infrastructure partners <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, as well as our friends at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">Thoughtbot</a> (3-time sponsor of the much-loved Rumble championship belt!), <a href="http://hashrocket.com">Hashrocket</a>, <a href="http://intridea.com">Intridea</a>, <a href="http://railskits.com">RailsKits</a>, <a href="http://techstars.com">TechStars</a>, <a href="http://spreedly.com">Spreedly</a>, and <a href="http://railsforum.com">Rails Forum</a>.</p><p>We&#8217;ve been overwhelmed by all the support thus far and only have two spots remaining at the &#8220;heavyweight&#8221; level (but many opportunities at the middleweight and lightweight levels). Please contact <a href="mailto:eshine@railsrumble.com">Erin Shine</a> if you&#8217;re interested in learning more about sponsorship options.</p>
