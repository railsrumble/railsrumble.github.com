<p>Rails Rumble 2009 Build Weekend is now officially over. Congrats to all the teams who competed and finished an application within the allotted time period. Because we&#8217;re such nice guys, contestants have a grace period of 6 hours within which you are allowed to make further profile edits. Take another look at those profiles and make sure you&#8217;ve described the purpose of your app for our judges, noted the resources that you used during development, and so on. However, and we want to be really clear about this, <strong>contestants may not make further commits to their repositories or deploy updated code to their Linodes</strong> without being disqualified.</p><p>The next phase of the competition is the qualifying round. During this phase, which starts tomorrow, our <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/judges/expert-panel">panel of expert judges</a> will review and rate each of the verified applications and decide, collectively, which ones advance to the final round for public voting. We&#8217;ll announce their findings later this week, when public judging opens. Stay tuned, cuz it ain&#8217;t over yet.</p>
