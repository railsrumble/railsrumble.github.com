It's official, we've filled all 300 team spots for the 2010 Rails Rumble!

### But What About Me?!

Didn't get your team in? All is not lost as registration is still open until the 17th. Register a team and be placed on the wait list. If an existing team withdraws, we'll fill the spot from the wait list on a first come, first served basis.
