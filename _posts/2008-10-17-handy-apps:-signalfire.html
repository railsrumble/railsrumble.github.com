<p>  With this year's competition just 9 hours away (as I write this), we wanted to draw  your attention to one of our sponsors' products &mdash; <a href="http://signalfire.com/">Signalfire</a>  by <a href="http://newleaders.com/">New Leaders</a> &mdash; which  we believe will come in handy for many teams.</p><div class="thumbnail" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://skitch.com/sutto/27mw/signalfire"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20081017-f695hufwfgked82rpntx3qd8d7.preview.jpg" alt="Signalfire" /></a></div><p>  Signalfire is a nice in-browser chat room ... but not just any old browser-based chat!  New Leaders' kick ass design makes it simple to do the majority of things most teams  need to do like invite new members to chat or upload mockups. And one of the best  features is that it's 100% <em>free</em> no matter how many rooms or members  you have.<p><p>  So if you still haven't organised a way for your team to communicate effectively,  make sure you check out <a href="http://signalfire.com/">Signalfire</a>.</p>
