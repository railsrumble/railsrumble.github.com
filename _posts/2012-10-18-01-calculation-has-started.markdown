Wow, what a week! Competitors, you should be extremely proud of yourself for making it this far! The [experts](http://railsrumble.com/experts) were hugely impressed with what you were able to build in just 48 hours and a ton of public judges came to the site and let their voices be heard as well.

And while we know how badly you want to fire off a deployment, **please wait until the winners are announced before deploying anything new**. It won't be much longer, we promise!

So, what comes next? Well, we've broken out our [TI-83 Plus's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series) and casino visors and have started to tally the votes from our experts for the overall winners and from the public for the public favorite award.

We'll be announcing the winners as soon as we're done (about 24 hours or so), so keep an eye on the [@railsrumble](http://twitter.com/railsrumble) Twitter account and our [blog](http://blog.railsrumble.com) for updates.

If you're looking for something to do in between refreshes of our blog, please spend some time checking out our [awesome sponsors](http://railsrumble.com/#sponsors) and then drool over [the prizes](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2012/10/13/prizes-prizes-prizes/) going to this year's winners.

Good luck to everyone!
