So, one of our Rumble superheroes unfortunately got bitten by a radioactive spider, and he's been really tied up since. \*cue snare\*

Unfortunately, this means we're going to have to delay registration by a little bit - we're really excited to get underway, but we need a little more time to follow up with sponsors, brush up on our legalese, and get everything completely settled. But keep an eye out, because registration won't be far off!

In the meantime:

### Rules for Remote Teams

We've had a few questions regarding digital assets before the competition. Obviously, we want to be fair to everyone, and teams that can meet up and do some planning on paper certainly have a leg up on the planning process. We want to make sure that teams that work remotely can still enjoy the planning process, so here's what we've come up with:

IF you want to some remote planning (say, a todo list, or some sketches of the site), that's fine. Writing some Rake tasks, or creating a ready-to-slice Photoshop file...these would be examples of stepping over the line. We don't want people creating digital assets that they will use in their production applications. So, be grown-ups, be responsible, and use things for planning, and not for production.

One caveat, if you do decide to do some remote planning, your work must be publicly available, and you must list it on your team's page (just like our policy with third-party libraries). If in doubt about what's fair, feel free to drop us a line, and we'll weigh in.

### Get Psyched!

We're so excited for this competition, and we hope you are too! We've been juggling stickers, logos, experts, prizes, sponsors, and exhibition categories, and they're all going to blow you away. So make sure to get thinking about your team, and stay tuned, because registration is right around the corner!!
