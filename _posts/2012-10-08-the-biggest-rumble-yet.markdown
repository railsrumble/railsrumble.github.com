After a week of open registration, we're extremely happy to announce that this year will be the biggest Rumble yet! We had **500 spots** available for teams this time around and they filled up fast. But it didn't stop there! A ton of teams came later in the week and were placed on our waiting list.

So what happens next? As you know, the competition starts on October 13th at 00:00 UTC &mdash; you have until then to add members to your team, combine teams, change teams, or drop out. But don't wait until the last minute, get in there and get it done.

## Something Come up? No Longer Able to Compete? Drop Out!

Spots are a precious commodity! They're in limited supply! Teams are on the wait list hoping to get yours! If you have a reserved spot and can no longer compete, **please leave your team so a team from the wait list can have your spot**. To do this, sign in via GitHub at [railsrumble.com](http://railsrumble.com), click your account button at the top, and click "Team Dashboard". From your team's dashboard, just click the "Leave" link next to your name. If you're the last member of the team, your team will be deleted and your spot will be given to the next team on the wait list.

## Invite Members to Your Team

You can add up to three other people to your team, so long as you do it before the competition starts. To do this, sign in via GitHub at [railsrumble.com](http://railsrumble.com), click your account button at the top, and click "Team Dashboard". From your team's dashboard, you'll be able to invite others to your team.

## Ditch Your Friends & Switch Teams

If you have a team of your own or are already on a team, you can leave yours and join another before the competition starts. To do this, sign in via GitHub at [railsrumble.com](http://railsrumble.com), click your account button at the top, and click "Team Dashboard". From your team's dashboard, just click the "Leave" link next to your name. If you're the last member of the team, your team will be deleted and your spot will be given to the next team on the wait list.

## Find More Teammates / Find Teams to Join

If you're looking for someone to join your team, or looking for a team to join, please check and update the [community wiki](https://github.com/railsrumble/community/wiki/Team-Vacancies-&-Potential-Participants). Don't be shy! It'll be okay. Just add your info and contact others on the list. There's still time!

## See You Soon!

We'll be emailing everyone later in the week with additional details regarding Linode and GitHub access, but don't forget: the competition starts promptly on October 13th at 00:00 UTC.
