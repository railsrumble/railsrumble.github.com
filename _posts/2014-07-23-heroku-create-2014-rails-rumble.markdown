The most important goal for the future of the Rails Rumble is to give everyone the opportunity to build the best entry they can. So today we're extremely happy to announce that we've partnered with the one and only [Heroku](http://heroku.com/?utm_source=railsrumble&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=2014_sponsorship) to bring you the most amazing and accessible Rails Rumble ever!

The 2014 Rails Rumble will take place on the weekend of **October 18th & 19th**.

* Registration: Oct. 6th - 12th
* Competition: Oct. 18th - 19th

If you aren't familiar with Heroku, they provide services and tools that let you focus on building apps, without worrying about infrastructure. You can have your app deployed in minutes and easily scale it to support millions of users. Give them a try by heading over to their site and [creating a free account](http://heroku.com/?utm_source=railsrumble&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=2014_sponsorship).

(In super cool announcer voice) But wait, there’s more!

## Heroku Add-Ons

Many of our sponsors this year will be available during the competition, free of charge, using Heroku's ridiculously powerful [add-on system](https://addons.heroku.com/?utm_source=railsrumble&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=2014_sponsorship).

Over the coming months, we’ll be announcing even more sponsors (in addition to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/?utm_source=railsrumble&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=2014_sponsorship), [GitHub](http://github.com), [Codebase](http://codebasehq.com), [Sirportly](http://sirportly.com), [Deploy](http://deployhq.com), and [Sprintly](https://sprint.ly/?utm_source=railsrumble&utm_medium=logo&utm_campaign=2014_sponsorship) - Thanks!), so if you have a product or service that’d you’d like smart, young, intelligent, thoughtful, developers and designers, from around the world to check out, [please let us know](http://railsrumble.com/sponsors/new).

## Re-Revamped Judging

While we're continually amazed by the number of Rails Rumble entries each year, we've been struggling with new ways to keep judging fair and easy, but still improve the Top 10 Winners list. After listening to your feedback, we’re very happy to announce that the judging for this year's Rumble will be in the hands of the community. If you ship an app, you're going to be considered a judge!

Additionally, this year each team will see exactly how many points they get, privately in their team's dashboard. We'll also be improving the entry browsing interface to include more tools and filters, that let you more easily see which apps you've visited, and which apps you’ve yet to try.

## Job Board

The last thing we’d like to announce is the [Rails Rumble Job Board](http://railsrumble.com/jobs). If you’re looking for a job, or have an opening and want to support the Rails Rumble, please consider checking it out.
