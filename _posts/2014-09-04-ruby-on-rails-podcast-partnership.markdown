title: "Partnering with 5by5's Ruby on Rails Podcast"
---

We're extremely excited to announce that we've partnered with [5by5's Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails), to bring you a whole heaping ton of shows with past winners, future winners, and co-runners of the Rails Rumble. We'd like to thank [Sean Devine](https://twitter.com/barelyknown), the slick speaking, silver tongued genius, behind the Ruby on Rails Podcast, for making this possible. That man can talk!

The first show from the series is up and it's [a behind the scenes interview with the co-runners of the Rails Rumble](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/166), Tom and Nick Mango. Stream it from their site, or subscribe and download it on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ruby-on-rails-podcast/id840890158?mt=2&uo=8&at=11laDR) or [RSS](http://feeds.5by5.tv/rubyonrails).

Thanks again to Sean and 5by5!
