<p>If you&#8217;ve been paying attention over the last couple of days, you probably noticed that the old Rails Rumble 2008 competition site (<a href="http://r08.railsrumble.com">archived</a>) has been replaced with a <a href="http://railsrumble.com">teaser for the upcoming 2009 event</a>. More info on that soon. Promise.</p><p>In the meantime, you can join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rails-rumble-announce">announcements list</a> or check out the new <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rails-rumble">discussion list</a> that we just set up (if you were previously subscribed to the 2008 alerts list, you will be getting an email invite to the new announcements list shortly). Oh and make sure to stalk us on <a href="http://twitter.com/railsrumble">Twitter</a>. Ttys.</p>
