title: Rumble Panel Needs Your Help!
---
<p><a href="http://railsconf.com">Railsconf</a> is less than two weeks away. I&#8217;m pretty excited because this year we&#8217;re doing a Rails Rumble panel with a bunch of swell people who developed some pretty amazing things within the compressed event timeframe. Winners and other innovators from both the 2007 and 2008 events will be present. The session is called <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/7765">&#8220;Starting Up Fast: Lessons from the Rails Rumble&#8221;</a> and the point of it is that these guys will be sharing the tips and tricks that let them build great stuff quick with Rails. Hopefully their advice will be applicable to your own startups and hobby projects, in &#8220;real life&#8221; as well as within the innovation competition atmosphere.</p><p>So this is where we need your help. What do you want to ask them about? Project scoping for early and frequent iterations? Essential dev tools and techniques? Finding dependable partners / cofounders? General work habit questions? Inspirational mantras? Anything goes. Please submit your questions via <a href="http://moderator.appspot.com/#16/e=53426">Google Moderator</a>. The event will be recorded and made available afterwards, so you won&#8217;t have to be in attendance to get your answers.</p>
