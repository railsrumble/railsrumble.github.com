The judging portion of the 2013 Rails Rumble has officially started! Please take some time over the next three days (judging ends on October 24th at 23:59 UTC), to [browse through the 200+ completed entries](http://railsrumble.com/entries/all) and pick your favorites. When you're done finding the ones you like the best, go to the [favorites section](http://railsrumble.com/entries/favorites) and get it down to your top ten, put them in order, and click the "finalize" button to lock in your picks!

*Note: Competitors and public judges aren't required to lock in their picks, but if they do, their top ten will appear on their profile page after the winners are announced.*

As a public judge or competitor, you'll be making your picks alongside our incredible panel of [expert judges](http://railsrumble.com/experts). Expert judges will be deciding the top 1 through 10 winners and who'll be getting the "Best Solo" prize. Public judges and competitors will be determining who gets the "Public Favorite" prize.

Oh, you didn't realize there were prizes? Well, there are. [A ton!](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2013/10/04/omg-prizes/)

Lastly, we urge you to leave feedback for the competitors. What did you love about their app? What didn't you love? How can they make it better? How brilliant was their app? Competitors love feedback, so send it their way! And remember, treat everyone with the [respect that they deserve](http://blog.railsrumble.com/conduct). This is a hard competition!

Winners will be announced on October 25th, after we finish counting up the votes. See you then!
