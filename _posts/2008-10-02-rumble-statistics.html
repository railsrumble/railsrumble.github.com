<p>  What an amazing week this has been for us here on the Rumble team.  We opened registration just under a week ago and in the first 4  days alone all of our initial 200 seats were taken. In light of this,  I thought it might be nice to share some of the stats for the competition so far.</p><h3>Teams</h3><p>  This year, we've got 200 accepted teams (that is, those who are already  confirmed to be competing) and another 14 on the waiting list. Of these teams,  The majority (110) are solo whilst 50, 28 and 26 and teams have 2, 3 and 4 members respectively.   We anticipate that a number of the solo teams will add members before the start of the competition,  as solo teams were a minority last year. Please note that you'll need to do this before the start of the  competition! There are also only 14 pending invites as of the moment.</p><div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/sutto/a1p2/google-maps"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20081002-1p5k8t9ky7amd8u1njy88akxwr.preview.jpg" alt="Google Maps" /></a><br /><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080">Uploaded with <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>'s <a href="http://skitch.com">Skitch</a>!</span></div><p>  Location wise, there is a huge mix of countries showing up, with the majority of entrants  being in the USA. We also have teams from Germany, Finland, Canada, Morocco, Israel, Spain, Russia, United Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, VN, Russian Federation, Croatia, Poland, Brazil, Italy, Austria, France, Sri Lanka, Venezuela, Serbia, Philippines, Belgium, Estonia, Canada, Thailand, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Portugal, MÃ©xico, Egypt and India.</p><h3>OpenID Adoption and Users</h3><p>  One of the things that blew my mind was just how widely adopted OpenID  is among our users. Before I get into the actual numbers, I'd like to  note our choice only to support OpenID this year was fuelled by the teams  belief it's an important part of making the competition less painful for  voters and an excellent way to simplify the registration process for individual apps.  Since every user participating in the Rumble (including voters) is guaranteed to  have an OpenID now, they don't have to worry about signing up for a hundred  different applications. Keep that in mind, developers, when you're building your  applications.</p><p>  With that in mind, of the 552 users (428 of whom are on a team), 443 of them already had pre-existing  OpenID accounts. That's more than we expected, to be honest. Oh, and those that didn't already have an  account are now the proud owners of an openid.railsrumble.com-branded OpenID, courtesy of our  partners at <a href="http://janrain.com/">Jan Rain</a> (who operate the popular <a href="http://myopenid.com">MyOpenID</a> service). </p><h3>What's to come</h3><p>  With all of that said and done, we've still got a long way to go. With the competition itself  on in just a few weeks, we're looking forward to posting more stats post-competition. Until then,  we'll be busy blogging about different aspects of the rumble so make sure you watch the blog.</p>
