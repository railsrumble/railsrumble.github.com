title: Expert Panel
---
<p>Our team of expert panel members will pre-qualify completed applications prior to public judging this year, in order to streamline the voting process. The highest rated applications, as determined by our panelists, will move on to the next round of judging, in which end users will decide the ultimate winners. In addition to rating entries, panelists will also leave personal comments for each application that they review; this means that each competing team will receive notes or advice from a minimum of 3 panel members, whether they go on to public voting or not.</p><p>Rails Rumble Expert Panelists include people that do great stuff from all parts of the web development and startup ecosystem: web developers, programmers, designers, user experience experts, startup and venture business folks, and media people. The panel also includes a number of influential Ruby community leaders.</p><h2>Panelists for the 2009 Contest</h2>
