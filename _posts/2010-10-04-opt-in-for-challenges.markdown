title: Opt In For Challenges!

We goofed a bit earlier and asked you to opt in for the challenge matches
before that option was even available in your profiles :). Ooops!

In any case, it's there now. If you plan on participating in one of the
<a href="/challenges">sponsor challenges</a> please edit your team profile
and select your challenge from the list.

You can opt in any time before the contest build weekend ends, but we
encourage you to do it early so you don't forget.
Also, if you're still thinking about what you want to build, there are some
great suggestions there -- everything from Twitter apps to A/V ideas to SAASy
goodness. So don't freak out, yo.
