title: This Bird's Ready to Rumble
---
<p><em><strong>Note: This is a guest post courtesy of our friends at <a href="http://intridea.com">Intridea</a></strong></em></p><p>Last year, there were a quite a few of Rails Rumble applications built around <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. And that was <strong>before</strong> <a href="http://twitter.com/Oprah">@Oprah</a>. We&#8217;ve had some experience building applications with, like, for, and around Twitter at <a href="http://www.intridea.com/">Intridea</a> and we thought that we could share a few useful gems (in both the knowledge and Ruby sense) that we&#8217;ve come across along the way. We expect to see a huge number of creative Twitter apps coming from the Rumble teams this year.</p><h3>Why Twitter?</h3><p>Twitter&#8217;s a great platform for the Rumble. Why? You don&#8217;t have to worry about that pesky &#8220;empty app effect&#8221; when your users sign into the application for the first time. You get to leverage the billions of existing tweets, giving you a huge head start on the competition.</p><p>Also, Twitter&#8217;s a really <strong>easy</strong> platform on which to build an app, especially a Rails app. After all, 48 hours is at least two or three weeks in Twitter years. Don&#8217;t believe us? Back in May, one of our Intrideans built a complete Twitter on Rails application on stage at RailsConf <a href="http://intridea.com/2009/5/8/railsconf-2009-twitter-on-rails">in about 30 minutes</a>. As Rumble participants, you&#8217;ve got up to 4 times as many people and nearly 100 times as long to build your apps. Almost seems too easy!</p><h3>Your Twitter Toolchest</h3><p>There are a great many Ruby libraries to interact with Twitter, but if you&#8217;re really looking to build a Twitter-centric application quickly, we recommend you take a look at <a href="http://github.com/mbleigh/twitter-auth">TwitterAuth</a>. TwitterAuth is a full authentication stack that connects using Twitter&#8217;s OAuth protocol. It does all the heavy lifting so you can stop worrying about getting users signed up and start worrying about what they&#8217;ll do once they are! There are already some interesting apps using TwitterAuth every day in production, like <a href="http://pix.im/">Pix.im</a>, a TwitPic alternative, and <a href="http://www.twittermass.com/">TwitterMass</a>.</p><p>Of course, Rails Templates are really the way to go if you&#8217;re looking to get an app up and running in the shortest time possible, and luckily there&#8217;s a TwitterAuth-based Rails template that will get you up and running in no time. <a href="http://intridea.com/2009/4/3/rails-template-create-a-twitter-application-in-seconds">Here&#8217;s a blog post about it</a>, or if you&#8217;re feeling adventurous you can just get started immediately:</p><pre><code>rails -m http://bit.ly/twitter-rails yourappname</code></pre><p>You will be walked through the setup process and at the end of the process you will be ready to start adding functionality to your app!</p><p>Of course, even applications that aren&#8217;t quite so Twitter-centric can benefit from some Twitter integration. Here&#8217;s a list of some resources that may inspire you to include them in your Rumble application in some way.</p><ul><li><a href="http://twitter.rubyforge.org/">Twitter</a> is one of the most popular gems for consuming the Twitter <span class="caps">API</span>, but we also like the simplicity and power of <a href="http://github.com/hayesdavis/grackle">Grackle</a>.</li><li><a href="http://github.com/squeejee/floxee/tree/master">Floxee</a> is an interesting project that lets you easily create a Rails Engines driven tweet-tracking directory. It&#8217;s sparse on documentation, but might be worth a look-through.</li><li>If you&#8217;re feeling adventurous, you might consider trying to work with the <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation">Twitter Streaming <span class="caps">API</span></a> using a library such as <a href="http://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/tree/master"><span class="caps">YAJL</span></a> to parse tweets off of the stream in real-time.</li><li>Maybe you just want a simple way to show off what people are saying about your app. A simple and customizable Javascript-driven Twitter search widget is <a href="http://tweetgrid.com/widget/">available through TweetGrid</a>.</li><li>If you run into some Twitter issues along the way, the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk">Twitter Development Talk</a> Google Group is pretty actively watched even by employees of Twitter (though perhaps not so much on the weekends). Use it as a resource of last resort!</li></ul><p>There&#8217;s a whole universe of existing <span class="caps">OSS</span> out there to connect with, post to, and otherwise fool around with Twitter. This is a small sampling we hope will give you some inspiration to get started on your Rumble app!</p><h3>Keep in Touch</h3><p>Of course, another reason that we&#8217;re so interested in Twitter, its <span class="caps">API</span>, and its applications is because of our flagship product, <a href="https://www.presentlyapp.com/">Present.ly</a>. Present.ly is a private micro-blogging platform for teams with groups, file-sharing, and a fully Twitter-compatible <span class="caps">API</span>. If your Rumble team is distributed across the country, Present.ly might be a great way to keep in touch during the competition. In fact, you can even <a href="https://presentlyapp.com/blog/2008/11/presently-github-integration">hook it up to GitHub</a> to get every commit your team posts during the competition live in your feed.</p><p>As we sign off, we&#8217;ll leave you with a list of Twittering Intrideans who will be competing in the Rumble this year:</p><ul><li>Adam Bair (<a href="http://twitter.com/adambair">@adambair</a>)</li><li>Michael Bleigh (<a href="http://twitter.com/mbleigh">@mbleigh</a>)</li><li>Brent Collier (<a href="http://twitter.com/brentmc79">@brentmc79</a>)</li><li>Pradeep Elankumaran (<a href="http://twitter.com/pradeep24">@pradeep24</a>)</li><li>Joe Grossberg (<a href="http://twitter.com/grossberg">@grossberg</a>)</li><li>Brendan Lim (<a href="http://twitter.com/brendanlim">@brendanlim</a>)</li><li>David Naffis (<a href="http://twitter.com/naffis">@naffis</a>)</li><li>David Potsiadlo (<a href="http://twitter.com/davidpots">@davidpots</a>)</li><li>Chris Selmer (<a href="http://twitter.com/cselmer">@cselmer</a>)</li><li>Ping Yu (<a href="http://twitter.com/pyu10055">@pyu10055</a>)</li></ul><p>We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing the awesome stuff the community comes up with for the Rumble, and best of luck to all the teams. We&#8217;ll see you on the Rumble-field!</p>
