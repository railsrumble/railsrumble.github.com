# Contest Rules

What follows is a quick summary of the rules. Before entering, you'll be asked to accept the full, official rules, which you can read below. If you have any questions, please feel free to email the [organizers](http://railsrumble.com/contact).

1. **Ruby on Rails**

    All applications must be built using Ruby on Rails or another Rack-based Ruby web framework. No substitutes!

2. **48 Hours**

    As a contestant, your team has exactly 48 hours to develop your web based application during the Rumble. The competition kicks off at 12:00AM UTC / 00:00 UTC on October 19th, 2013 and will end at 11:59PM / 23:59 UTC on October 20th, 2013.

    You can, of course, work on the concept for your application before the competition starts, including paper and / or digital mockups of the user interface and database entity diagrams. However, no production assets of any kind can be created until the start of the official competition period illustrated above. This includes "ready to slice" graphic design assets, application code, and user stores / test cases (on the other hand, [Sprint.ly](http://sprint.ly) & [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com) type stories are fine). Please post any information of this sort publicly, and make sure to list these items on your team profile page in order to prevent any questioning. Plan, don't create. And if you're in doubt, send us an email to verify.

    After the initial 48 hours are up, you'll be judged on what you've completed. No additional features or bugfixes are allowed after the 48 hours are up, or you'll be disqualified.

3. **Teams of One to Four Humans**

    Teams must be comprised of between one and four individuals. No more than four people are allowed on a team. To be eligible, teams must register at least 1 week prior to the start of the competition (space subject to availability). Additionally, every team member must have a GitHub account to register. No robots, aliens, or superheroes allowed. However, team members should feel free to dress as robots, aliens, and superheroes.

4. **Source Control at GitHub**

    We'll provide your team with a free private Git repository courtesy of [GitHub](http://github.com). As you develop your application, you should push your progress to the repository. You should push regularly ("commit early, commit often") in order to demonstrate progress.

    Note that organizers will be observing checkins to monitor validity and progress throughout both the development portion of the contest and the judging process. Don't plan on doing anything tricky like developing your application in its entirety ahead of time, rebasing it and pushing it in at 9AM Saturday morning and relaxing with a Mimosa. That's bad.

    Before the contest ends, you must mark your entry as complete on the team profile and tag a release of your code with the word "rumble12". This should be the version deployed on your Linode and will be validated by our automated qualifier system.

5. **Deployment at Linode**

    A big part of running a successful web application is knowing how to deploy and maintain it. Thanks to the participation of our sponsors, every team gets their own [Linode](http://linode.com) virtual server to use in deploying their applications. This account information will be provided to you via your Rails Rumble account prior to the Contest Timeframe. You understand that you are responsible for configuration and maintenance of this account during the competition timeframe. However, we'll have help available should you need it.

    Competition organizers will also require access to your Linode account during the judging period via supplied SSH keys. The deployed codebase may occasionally be compared to the final tagged version (as of the competition closing) to make sure you haven't introduced additional features or bugfixes during the judging period. You may access your Linode account during the judging period to restart a stuck process or perform routine maintenance, however.

6. **Leverage Others**

    Third party software, in the form of RubyGems or Plugins are allowed, even encouraged (if publicly available and allowed for the use intended by this contest). Please make sure to update your team profile once the competition has started, and list any third party libraries, plugins, or other applications (e.g. ImageMagick, ffmpeg, etc) that you make use of. Third party JavaScript libraries, Flash widgets, and other component libraries, are allowed. You must update your profile to list any external libraries that are in use and give appropriate credit and citations.

    Stock photography, icon sets, and publicly available templates are allowed. Teams are prohibited from commissioning or otherwise paying for any content that is created specifically for the application as opposed to being publicly available for everyone's use. Developing a plugin or library before the competition that provides your application's general functionality is considered cheating. Developing a plugin or library that is publicly available and provides a general purpose publicly usable function (such as accessing an API) can be done before the competition begins. Purchases will not improve your chances of winning. This is a skill-based contest.

    Your application can make use of any non-paid and publicly available third party web services. This means that services provided by established services such as Google, Yahoo, Flickr, Twitter, etc are all possible and allowable. As before, make sure to update your profile to list dependencies on third party services and give credit to those services accordingly.

    If you have a question about a particular piece of third party software, please [contact competition organizers for clarification](http://railsrumble.com/contact).

7. **Ownership & Open Source**

    Hey, we're just running a competition here. What you do with your source once the competition is over is up to you. Open sourcing your code will neither hurt not improve your chances. It's up to you. Please note that competition organizers will have access to your codebase throughout the competition, in order to make sure that no cheating occurs, but we won't steal anything, we promise! We do reserve the right to use your application's likeness as a promotion for this or future contests.

8. **User Privacy**

    Because your application will be awesome, lots of people will be reviewing it and playing around with it during the competition and review period. In the interest of protecting their information, we're imposing a non-optional privacy policy for the duration of the event. You are not to reveal any user information to any third party, except when required by law. You are not to use account emails for any purpose other than the standard operation of your application. If you choose to continue developing your application after the Rumble has ended, you are required to notify users of any changes in your privacy policy, so they can remove the information if they so choose. For the duration of this competition you hereby agree to abide by the [Privacy Policy](/privacy) of the Rails Rumble competition.

9. **You Will Be Judged**

    A panel of expert judges will pick their 10 favorite applications and rank them from 1 through 10. At the end of the competition, these expert rankings will be combined to find the top 10 overall winners, ranked 1 through 10. Additionally, a special "Best Solo" award will be given based on expert rankings. Expert judges may pick from all, non-disqualified entries.

    Separate from expert judges, any member of the public or contestant may also pick their favorite application. At the end of the competition, the application that receives the most favorites from the public will receive a special "Public Favorite" award. Public judges may pick from all, non-disqualified entries.

10. **You Don't Need To Sling Code To Get Involved**

    You don't need to hack Ruby or Rails to participate. We encourage front end designers to get involved too! Find a team and help out with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and graphics work. Additionally, we anticipate that only a small fraction of the people involved in this event will be on teams contributing applications. You can be a huge part of the process just by signing up for an account, and participating in the public judging once the build portion of the competition is complete.

### 48 Hours

As a contestant, your team has exactly 48 hours to develop your web based application during the event. The competition kicks off at 12:00am / 00:00 UTC on October 19th, 2013 and will end at 11:59PM / 23:59 UTC on October 20th, 2013 ("Contest timeframe"). You can, of course, work on the concept for your application before the competition starts, including paper and / or digital mockups of the user interface and database entity diagrams. However, no production assets of any kind can be created until the start of the official competition period illustrated above. This includes "ready to slice" graphic design assets, application code, and executable user stories / test cases (on the other hand, [Sprint.ly](http://sprint.ly) & [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com) type stories are fine).

After those 48 hours are completed at 11:59PM / 23:59 UTC on October 20th, 2013, an expert panel and a jury of peer judges will be invited to use your application and judge it against the competition in the manner described below. No additional features or bug fixes are allowed during this period, or you will be disqualified. For full instructions on how to participate and contest requirements, see below.

### Teams

Teams should be comprised of between one and four individuals. No more than four people are allowed on a team. To be eligible, teams must register at least 1 week prior to the start of the competition (space subject to availability).

### Source Control

We'll provide your team with a free private Git repository courtesy of [GitHub](http://github.com). The account details for this Git repository will be provided via your Rails Rumble account prior to the Contest Timeframe. As you develop your application, you should push your progress to the repository. You should push to the repository regularly ("commit early, commit often") in order to demonstrate progress.

Note that organizers will be observing checkins to monitor validity and progress throughout both the development portion of the contest and the judging process.

Prior to the conclusion of the Contest Timeframe, 11:59PM / 23:59 UTC on October 20th, 2013, you must mark your entry as complete on your team profile page and tag a release of your code with the word "rumble12". This should be the version deployed on your Linode and will be validated by our automated qualifier system.

### Deployment

A big part of running a successful web application is knowing how to deploy and maintain it. Thanks to the participation of our sponsors, every team gets their own [Linode](http://linode.com) virtual server to use in deploying their applications. This account information will be provided to you via your Rails Rumble account prior to the Contest Timeframe You understand that you are responsible for configuration and maintenance of this account during the competition timeframe. However, we'll have help available should you need it.

Teams will be judged on the overall user experience. If an application crashes or is generally unresponsive, peer reviewers are likely to give an unpleasant score. It is the responsibility of the team to ensure that they develop and deploy a robust entry. Access information for your Linode will be provided with source control information before the competition begins. Linode-hosted applications will remain online and hosted until the winners are announced – shortly after voting closes.

Note that during the judging period, competition organizers will also require access to your Linode via supplied SSH keys in order to monitor validity of deployed source code. You should not attempt to change the account credentials for the organizers account. The deployed codebase may occasionally be compared to the final tagged version (as of the competition closing) to make sure that you haven't introduced additional features or bugfixes during the judging period. You may access your Linode during the judging period to restart a stuck process or perform routine maintenance, code changes are explicitly forbidden.

### Third Party Software

Third party software, in the form of RubyGems or Plugins are allowed, even encouraged (if publicly available and allowed for the use intended by this contest). Please make sure to update your team profile once the competition has started, and list any third party libraries, plugins, or other applications (e.g. ImageMagick, ffmpeg, etc) that you make use of. Third party JavaScript libraries, Flash widgets, and other component libraries, are allowed. You must update your profile to list any external libraries that are in use and give appropriate credit and citations.

Stock photography, icon sets, and publicly available templates are allowed. Teams are prohibited from commissioning or otherwise paying for any content that is created specifically for the application as opposed to being publicly available for everyone's use. Developing a plugin or library before the competition that provides your application's general functionality is considered cheating. Developing a plugin or library that is publicly available and provides a general purpose publicly usable function (such as accessing an API) can be done before the competition begins. Purchases will not improve your chances of winning. This is a skill-based contest.

Your application can make use of any non-paid and publicly available third party web services. This means that services provided by established services such as Google, Yahoo, Flickr, Twitter, etc are all possible and allowable. As before, make sure to update your profile to list dependencies on third party services and give credit to those services accordingly.

If you have a question about a particular piece of third party software, please [contact competition organizers for clarification](http://railsrumble.com/contact).

### Ownership and Open Source

What you do with your application source code once the competition is over is up to you. Individual teams retain all rights, interests in, and title to the source code they create for this competition. If you choose not to open source your application that is within your discretion and has no bearing on your chances of winning this competition. There are no penalties for wanting to safeguard your source. We hope that a number of participants use this opportunity to launch disruptive ideas, or maybe even the first version of a software startup, and understand that sometimes part of a viable business strategy is keeping your application source code private.

Note that the competition organizers will have access to your code base throughout the competition, in order to make sure that no cheating occurs (as outlined previously). Competition organizers will not re-use or distribute such source code materials in any way, unless given explicit permission by the contestant.

Rails Rumble reserves the right to refer to your web-based application as promotion for this contest or future contests and may include your team name and other information contained in your registration for promotional purposes. Additionally information in your team profile will be available to judges and peer judges. Please see our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) for further details.

### User Privacy

Many people, aka expert panelists, peer judges, and other visitors, will be reviewing and using your application during the judging period of the competition. In the interest of protecting their information, we're imposing a non-optional privacy policy for the duration of the event. You are not to reveal any user information to any third party, except when required by law. You are not to use account emails for any purpose other than the standard operation of your application. If you choose to continue developing your application after the event has ended, you are required to notify users of any changes in your privacy policy, so they can remove the information if they so choose. For the duration of this competition you hereby agree to abide by the Privacy Policy of the Rails Rumble competition.

Judges: If you registered with Rails Rumble as a peer judge, in the process of judging this competition, you may come into contact with personal, confidential or proprietary information of the contest entrants (teams). Be aware that by accepting the Privacy Policy, you hereby agree to abide by it and respect the confidentiality of the contest entrants.

### Judging

There are limited spots available. Each team will submit a single entry. Spots are reserved by teams on a first come, first serve, basis.

Judging, will occur after the build portion of the competition is completed. Both expert judges and public judges will pick their 10 favorite entries and rank them from 1 through 10, at the same time. Expert judge rankings will result in the top ten overall winners. Public judges will result in a single "Public Favorite" award.

The expert panel of industry judges will be made up of experts in different fields throughout the industry. The identity of these judges will be disclosed to the teams prior to the Contest Timeframe. The expert judging period will take place from October 22th, 2013 until October 24th, 2013.

All judging will occur from the perspective of an average consumer / Internet end user. Meaning, code quality will not be judged. We believe code quality to be a highly subjective affair, and thorough reviews are extremely time-intensive and not in the best interests of this competition. Your application will be judged based on it's visible merits. In particular, we ask judges to consider a number of aspects including: originality, usefulness, appearance, and completeness. However, these categories are not individually rated.

Each judge (both expert panel members as well as public judges) will choose their 10 favorite entries and rank them in order from 1st through 10th. We strongly encourage contestants to use development best practices but in the end judges are expected to rate applications based on their visible merits.

At the conclusion of the expert judging period, an overall top ten ranking (places 1 through 10), solely based on combined rankings from all expert judges, will be revealed as the winners.

Public judges are members of the general public that have registered with Rails Rumble to participate in judging. Public judging will also occur from October 22th, 2013 until October 24th, 2013. These public judges will award a single "Public Favorite" award.

Further, a "Solo" award will be given to the team with a single member that has the highest expertly judged rank.

Organizers reserve the right to disqualify any team that is believed to be cheating or not competing in the spirit of the event, in their sole discretion.

Please note that Organizers, Expert Judges, and Public Judges are not subject to any non-disclosure, confidentiality agreements, or additional privacy policies unless otherwise noted in this document.

Contest entrants may participate in the public judging round and are permitted to judge their own applications and the applications of other entrants.

Exact dates for judging periods are subject to change.

### Prizes
