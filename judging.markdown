# The Finer Points

## How Entries Are Displayed

When [browsing entries]((http://railsrumble.com/entries/all)), please note that the list **is randomized for you**. Each time you go in, you'll see the same order of entries. However, different people see different orders. Try viewing the entries list while not signed in, from a different browser.

## How Points Are Calculated

Starting with the 2014 Rails Rumble, every competitor that ships an app is considered a judge. The sum of every competitor judge's favorites will determine who wins the the overall 1st through 10th awards and the Best Solo award. Additionally, favorites from anyone that isn't a competitor judge (they can sign in via Heroku or Twitter once the judging period officially opens) will determine the Public Favorite award.

You can see prizes for the 2014 Rails Rumble [in this blog post](http://blog.railsrumble.com/2014/10/03/prizes-prizes-prizes/).

No matter who you are, you can have up to ten favorite entires that count for points. So, as you [browse and visit entries](http://railsrumble.com/entries/all), favorite the ones you like. When you're done, go to [your favorites list](http://railsrumble.com/entries/favorites) and reorder your top ten. **After you finalize the picks** on [your favorites list](http://railsrumble.com/entries/favorites), your points will be locked in. Your #1 favorite counts for 10 points. Your #2 favorite counts for 9 points. This continues all the way down your #10 favorite, which counts for 1 point. No other favorites count towards awards.

After the judging period concludes, all of the points will be summed up and the top ten winners, Best Solo, and Public Favorite will be revealed. Nothing else affects points awarded to entries. That's it.

If you competed, your team's collected points will be revealed to you privately in your team's dashboard, if you'd care to see that.

# A Complete Judging How To

## What to Look For

The Rails Rumble provides no restrictions on what competitors *should* build. They can build a productivity app, a game, a communication tool, or anything else they can think of. And as a community judged event, whatever entries the community collectively feels should win, will surface to the top and be awarded prizes.

Having said that, here are a few things you may want to look for when picking your favorites:

* Is it clear what this entry is meant to do?
* Does the entry work and do what is intended?
* Does the entry appeal to you or can you see how it may appeal to others?

Additionally, this is a Ruby specific competition and we urge you to consider the parts of the entry built in Ruby. However, as Ruby has matured, everyone understands that it is often used to fill the role of a backend service, and this may be essential to the app's function. Use your best judgement.

4. The top ten entries you pick are assigned points in decreasing order from #1 to #10. Your #1 pick is assigned 10 points and your #10 pick is assigned 1 point. Any entry you favorited that appears after your tenth pick won't be counted when we tally the votes.
5. After you've ordered your top ten favorites, click the "I'm Done - Finalize My Picks" button to let us know you're done and that we can assign points and count your picks.
